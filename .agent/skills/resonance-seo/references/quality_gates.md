# Content Quality Gates

## Minimum Word Counts by Page Type

| Page Type | Min Words | Unique Content % | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| Homepage | 500 | 100% | Must clearly communicate value proposition |
| Service / Feature Page | 800 | 100% | Detailed explanation of offering |
| Location (Primary) | 600 | 60%+ | City headquarters or main service area |
| Location (Secondary) | 500 | 40%+ | Satellite locations |
| Blog Post | 1,500 | 100% | In-depth, valuable content |
| Product Page | 400 | 80%+ | Unique descriptions, specs |

## Location Page Thresholds

### Warning Level (30+ pages)
- ⚠️ **WARNING** at 30+ location pages
- Enforce 60%+ unique content per page
- Content must include:
  - Unique local information (landmarks, neighborhoods)
  - Location-specific services or offerings
  - Local team or staff information

### Hard Stop (50+ pages)
- 🛑 **HARD STOP** at 50+ location pages
- Require explicit user justification
- Must demonstrate:
  - Legitimate business presence in each location
  - Unique content strategy for each page
  - Local signals (Google Business Profile, local reviews)

## Safe vs. Risky Programmatic Pages

### Safe at Scale ✅
- Integration pages: Real setup documentation
- Template/tool pages: Downloadable assets
- Glossary pages: 200+ word unique definitions
- Product pages: Unique specs, images, reviews

### Penalty Risk ❌
- Location pages with only city swapped (Doorway pages)
- "Best [tool] for [industry]" (Thin affiliate content)
- "[Competitor] alternative" (Requires genuine comparison data)
- AI-generated mass content (No unique value)

## AI Pattern Fatigue (Entropy Check)

To prevent algorithmic flagging of AI content, all pages must demonstrate **Controlled Entropy**:

1.  **Format Variance**: No more than 2 paragraphs of text in a row without a visual break (list, table, quote, image).
2.  **Rhythm Variance**: Sentences must vary in length. A block of 3 sentences with identical structure is a fail.
3.  **Tone Modulation**: Content must shift between "Technical" and "Conversational" at least once per 500 words.

> **Failure Condition**: "Wall of Text" with perfect grammar and no structural disruption.

## Internal Linking Guidelines

| Page Type | Internal Links Target |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Blog post (1,500+ words) | 5-10 internal links |
| Service page | 3-5 internal links |
| Category page | Links to all child pages |

### Anchor Text Rules
- Use descriptive anchor text (not "click here")
- Vary anchor text (don't always use exact match keywords)
- Link to relevant, related content
- Ensure no orphan pages (every page linked from at least one other page)
