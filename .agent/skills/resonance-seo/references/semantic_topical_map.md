# Semantic Topical Map Protocol

> "You don't rank for keywords. You rank for Topics."

## 1. The Authority Pillar

You cannot write one random post about "React" and expect to rank. You need a **Cluster**.
*   **Pillar Page**: "The Ultimate Guide to React". (Links to all sub-pages).
*   **Cluster Content**: "React Hooks", "React State", "React Performance". (Link back to Pillar).

## 2. The Knowledge Graph

Google stores data in triplets: `(Entity) -> [Relationship] -> (Attribute)`.
*   **Your Goal**: Define these triplets in your content.
*   **Text**: "Resonance (Entity) is a (Relationship) Framework (Attribute)."

## 3. The Gap Analysis

1.  Take your Competitor.
2.  Scrape their Sitemap.
3.  Cluster their topics.
4.  **Find the Hole**: "They have 50 pages on React, but 0 on React Server Components." -> **Attack there**.

> 🔴 **Rule**: Complete the cluster. Do not leave a topic 50% covered. Google rewards completeness.
