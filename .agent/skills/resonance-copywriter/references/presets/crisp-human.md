**Vibe**: The Busy Executive. The Twitter Thread. The Slack update.
**Goal**: Speed and Impact.

## Rules
1.  **Max Sentence Length**: 15 words.
2.  **Fragments**: Encouraged. (e.g., "No fluff.", "Just results.")
3.  **Adjectives**: Kill 90% of them.
4.  **Verbs**: Strong, active verbs only. No "is/are/was".

## Example
