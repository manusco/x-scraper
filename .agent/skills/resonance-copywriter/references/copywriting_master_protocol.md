# Protocol: The Copywriting Masterfile
> **Focus**: Textual Engineering & Optimization
> **Resonance Phase**: Execution / Conversion

## 1. The Engineering of Words
Copywriting is not "creative writing." It is **Behavioral Engineering**. We use words to remove friction and increase motivation (Fogg Behavior Model).

**The Core Axioms**:
1.  **Clarity > Cleverness**: If they don't understand it, they can't buy it.
2.  **Specifics > Generalities**: "Save 12hrs/week" > "Save time".
3.  **Benefits > Features**: "1TB Storage" (Feature) -> "Keep every photo you've ever taken" (Benefit).

## 2. The Architecture of a Page (The Anatomy)

### The Hero Section (Above the Fold)
*   **H1 (The Promise)**: The single most desirable outcome your user wants.
    *   *Formula*: `[Outcome] without [Pain Point]`.
    *   *Example*: "Deploy in seconds, without managing infrastructure."
*   **Sub-H1 (The Mechanism)**: How you deliver the promise. Authenticate the claim.
*   **CTA (The Action)**: Low-friction command. `Start Building` > `Submit`.

### The Argument Structure (The Body)
1.  **The Problem**: Agitate the pain. "You are tired of X."
2.  **The Agitation**: Why it sucks. "It costs you Y."
3.  **The Solution**: Your mechanism.
4.  **The Proof**: Social evidence (Logos, Testimonials, Data).

## 3. Protocol: The Seven Sweeps (Linting for Words)
Just as we lint code, we lint copy. Run these 7 passes sequentially.

### Sweep 1: Clarity (The Compiler Check)
*   **Check**: Are there any ambiguous pronouns ("it", "they")?
*   **Action**: Replace "It saves you time" with "The Autoloader saves you time."

### Sweep 2: Voice & Tone (The Style Guide)
*   **Check**: Does it sound like *us*? usage of "We" vs "I".
*   **Action**: Ensure consistency. if you start casual ("Hey!"), don't end corporate ("Sincerely, The Management").

### Sweep 3: The "So What?" (Logic Validation)
*   **Check**: For every feature, ask "So what?"
*   **Action**: "We have AI" -> So what? -> "So you can work faster." -> So what? -> "So you can go home at 5pm." **Write that.**

### Sweep 4: Proof Injection (Reference Checking)
*   **Check**: Are claims unsubstantiated? "Best in class" (According to whom?)
*   **Action**: Delete superlatives unless backed by data. "Rated 4.9/5 by 200 devs" > "Best rated".

### Sweep 5: Specificity (Data Typing)
*   **Check**: Vague words ("fast", "scalable", "easy").
*   **Action**: Replace with specific integers. "200ms latency", "10k rps", "3-click setup".

### Sweep 6: Heightened Emotion (UX Polish)
*   **Check**: Is it dry?
*   **Action**: Inject sensory words. "Frustrated" -> "Keyboard-smashing mad".

### Sweep 7: Risk Reversal (Error Handling)
*   **Check**: What stops the click? (Fear of cost, lock-in, complexity).
*   **Action**: Add "No credit card required", "Cancel anytime", "Open Source".

## 4. Micro-Copy Rules (The Syntax)
*   **Buttons**: Finish the sentence "I want to..." -> `[Download the Report]`.
*   **Headlines**: Title Case for standard, Sentence case for conversational.
*   **Paragraphs**: Max 3 lines.
*   **Passive Voice**: Banned. "Mistakes were made" -> "We made a mistake."
