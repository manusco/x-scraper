> "We are not rational machines. We are emotional pattern-matchers."

## 1. The 6 Principles

1.  **Reciprocity**: "I gave you something, now you owe me."
    *   *Implementation*: Free E-book, Free Trial, "Valuable Content" before ask.
2.  **Commitment & Consistency**: "I said I would, so I will."
    *   *Implementation*: Micro-commitments ("Get Started" -> Email -> Password -> Payment).
3.  **Social Proof**: "Everyone else is doing it."
    *   *Implementation*: "10,000 users", Logos, Testimonials, "Someone just bought..." notifications.
4.  **Authority**: "The expert says so."
    *   *Implementation*: "Dr.", "PhD", Uniforms, Certifications, "As seen on Forbes".
5.  **Liking**: "I like you, so I buy from you."
    *   *Implementation*: "About Us" page with faces, Humor, Shared values ("We hate spam too").
6.  **Scarcity**: "I might miss out."
    *   *Implementation*: "Only 3 left", "Offer ends tonight", "Waitlist full".

## 2. The Ethics Check

*   **White Hat**: True scarcity ("We only take 5 clients").
*   **Black Hat**: Fake timers (Resets on refresh). **BANNED**.

> 🔴 **Rule**: Fake urgency kills trust forever. Use real constraints.
