# StoryBrand Framework (The SB7 Protocol)

> "The customer is the Hero, not your brand."
> — Donald Miller

## 1. The 7-Part Script

1.  **A Character (The Hero)**
    *   What do they want? (e.g., "A clean home").
2.  **Has a Problem**
    *   **Villain**: The root cause (e.g., "Dirt").
    *   **External**: The physical problem (e.g., "Messy floor").
    *   **Internal**: How it makes them feel (e.g., "Embarrassed").
3.  **And Meets a Guide (You)**
    *   **Empathy**: "We understand how you feel."
    *   **Authority**: "We have helped 1,000 others."
4.  **Who Gives Them a Plan**
    *   Step 1 -> Step 2 -> Step 3. (Simplicity is key).
5.  **And Calls Them to Action**
    *   Direct CTA: "Buy Now". (Not "Learn More").
6.  **That Helps Them Avoid Failure**
    *   What happens if they don't buy? (e.g., "Scanning for viruses...").
7.  **And Ends in a Success**
    *   What does the "After" state look like? (e.g., "Peace of mind").

## 2. The Mandate

*   **Rule**: If you talk about yourself in the first paragraph, you lose. Talk about their problem.
*   **The Grunt Test**: Can a caveman look at your hero section for 5 seconds and know:
    1.  What do you offer?
    2.  How will it make my life better?
    3.  What do I need to do to buy it?
