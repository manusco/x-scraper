# Fact Preservation Rules

> **Objective**: Rewrite the *Style*, preserve the *Truth*.

## Immutable Data types
**NEVER CHANGE THESE:**
1.  **Proper Nouns**: Names of people, companies, products (e.g., "Resonance", "John Doe").
2.  **Numbers & Metrics**: Prices, percentages, versions (e.g., "$99", "45%", "v2.0").
3.  **Dates & Times**: "Monday", "2024", "10:00 AM".
4.  **URLs & Paths**: File paths, links, email addresses.
5.  **Quotes**: Text inside quotation marks attributed to a specific person.

## The Preservation Check
Before finalizing any rewrite, run this mental diff:
*   [ ] Did the price change?
*   [ ] Did the feature name change?
*   [ ] Did the timeline change?

If ANY fact is altered, the rewrite is a FAILURE, regardless of style quality.
