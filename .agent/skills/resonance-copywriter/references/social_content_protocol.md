# Protocol: Social Distribution Engineering
> **Focus**: Algorithmic Reach & Content Repurposing
> **Resonance Phase**: Growth / Awareness

## 1. The Distribution Engine
Social Media is not "posting." It is **Distribution Engineering**. It is the process of atomizing your core intellectual property (IP) and injecting it into algorithmic feeds to capture attention.

**The Core Loop**:
`Core Insight` -> `Atomization` -> `Platform Adaptation` -> `Distribution` -> `Feedback Analysis`

## 2. Reverse Engineering Patterns
Do not guess. Analyze the "Source Code" of viral content.

### Pattern: The Hook-Reward Loop
Every successful post follows this structure:
1.  **The Hook (Stop the Scroll)**: A pattern interrupt.
    *   *Contrarian*: "SEO is dead."
    *   *Specific*: "I spent $50k on Ads. Here is what I learned."
    *   *Story*: "I almost quit yesterday."
2.  **The Body (The Payoff)**: High-density value. No fluff.
    *   Lists, Frameworks, "How-to" steps.
3.  **The CTA (The Capture)**: "Follow for more", "Link in bio", "Retweet".

## 3. Platform Architecture

### LinkedIn (The Professional Graph)
*   **Algorithm Preference**: Dwell time, Comments, PDF Carousels.
*   **Format**: "Broetry" (Short lines, white space) or "Slide Decks" (Pdf uploads).
*   **Strategy**: "Build in Public", Career advice, Corporate data.

### Twitter/X (The Interest Graph)
*   **Algorithm Preference**: Replies, Threads, Retweets.
*   **Format**: Threads (1 Hook + 5-10 value tweets).
*   **Strategy**: High velocity, "Hot takes", Threading specific tutorials.

### YouTube / Video (The Algorithm)
*   **Algorithm Preference**: Watch time (Retention), CTR (Thumbnails).

## 4. The Repurposing Pipeline (Write Once, Distribute Everywhere)
Do not create unique content for every channel. Create **Pillars**.

**Source**: 1 Deep-Dive Blog Post or Video.
**Downstream Artifacts**:
1.  **Twitter Thread**: Extract the top 5 insights.
2.  **LinkedIn Post**: Summarize the "Business Lesson" or story.
3.  **Newsletter**: Send the full deep dive to subscribers.
4.  **Shorts/Reels**: 60s video of the main point.

## 5. Engagement Protocol
Distribution is bi-directional.
*   **The 30-Min Rule**: Engage heavily for the first 30 mins after posting to spike algorithmic signals.
*   **Reply Strategy**: Reply to every comment with a question to double the comment count (Algorithmic boost).
*   **The "Daughter" Nodes**: Comment on big accounts in your niche. Piggyback on their distribution.

## 6. Metrics (The Dashboard)
*   **Impressions**: Top of Funnel (Hook quality).
*   **Engagement Rate**: Middle of Funnel (Content quality).
*   **Profile Clicks**: Bottom of Funnel (Bio/Offer quality).
