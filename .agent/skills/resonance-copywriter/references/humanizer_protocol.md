# Humanizer Protocol (The Anti-Robot Law)

> "Perfect structure feels algorithmic. Tangents, asides, and half-formed thoughts are human."

## 1. The Banned Vocabulary List (Instant Deletion)

**If you use these words, you are failing.**

*   **Verbs**: `delve`, `underscore`, `embarked`, `foster`, `showcase`, `illustrate`, `highlight`, `navigating`, `harnessing`.
*   **Adjectives**: `pivotal`, `crucial`, `vibrant`, `tapestry`, `intricate`, `groundbreaking`, `game-changing`, `seamless`, `robust`, `comprehensive`.
*   **Nouns**: `landscape` (abstract), `testament`, `paradigm`, `realm`, `symphony`, `beacon`.
*   **Phrases**:
    *   "In the ever-evolving landscape..."
    *   "It is important to note that..."
    *   "Serves as a testament to..."
    *   "Not only X but also Y..." (Negative Parallelism).

## 2. Style Violations (The Dead Giveaways)

1.  **The "Colon List"**:
    *   ❌ **Efficiency:** We do this fast.
    *   ✅ We do this fast, so you save time.
    *   *Rule*: Never use Bold Header + Colon. Write sentences.
2.  **The "Em Dash" Overload**:
    *   ❌ It is fast—really fast—and cool.
    *   ✅ It is fast. It is also cool.
    *   *Rule*: Max 1 em-dash per 500 words.
3.  **The "Title Case" Header**:
    *   ❌ Why We Are The Best
    *   ✅ Why we are the best
    *   *Rule*: Sentence case for all headers.
4.  **The "Bold" Abuse**:
    *   ❌ It blends **OKRs** and **KPIs**.
    *   ✅ It blends OKRs and KPIs.
    *   *Rule*: Use bold only for the ONE most important sentence in a section.

## 3. The Soul Injection (How to Pass the Turing Test)

1.  **Have an Opinion**:
    *   ❌ "There are pros and cons to this approach."
    *   ✅ "I hate this approach, but it works."
2.  **Vary Rhythm (Burstiness)**:
    *   Write a 3-word sentence. Then write a 20-word sentence that meanders and explores a thought before coming back to the point. Then a 2-word sentence.
3.  **Use "I" (First Person)**:
    *   ❌ "This guide explores..."
    *   ✅ "Here is what I found..."
4.  **Acknowledge Uncertainty**:
    *   ❌ "This is the perfect solution."
    *   ✅ "This solution is messy, but it's the best we have."

> 🔴 **Rule**: If it sounds "professional" and "clean", it is likely robotic. Add some grit.
