## 1. The Banned List (The Slop)
*If you see these words, delete or rewrite them immediately.*

| The Word | Why it's Slop | The Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Delve"** | The #1 indicator of GPT-4. | "Dig into", "Explore", "Analyze". |
| **"Tapestry"** | Cliché metaphor for complexity. | "Mix", "Web", "Network". |
| **"Testament"** | "A testament to..." is hollow praise. | Show the proof directly. |
| **"Landscape"** | "The digital landscape..." | "The market", " The industry". |
| **"Elevate"** | Marketing fluff. | "Improve", "Raise", "Boost". |
| **"Unleash"** | Hyperbole. | "Release", "Empower". |
| **"Seamless"** | Nothing is seamless. | "Easy", "Integrated". |
| **"Foster"** | Corporate speak. | "Build", "Create", "Grow". |

## 2. Sentence Structure Rules

### Rule A: Ban the "Colon List"
*   ❌ **AI Style**: "We offer three benefits: 1. Speed, 2. Quality, 3. Price."
*   ✅ **Human Style**: "We offer speed, quality, and price." (Flowing sentences).

### Rule B: Kill the "Conclusion Paragraph"
AI loves to summarize at the end ("In conclusion, X represents a paradigm shift...").
*   **Fix**: Just stop. If the article is done, end it on a high note or a call to action. No summaries.

### Rule C: Active Voice Only
*   ❌ "The code was refactored by the team."
*   ✅ "The team refactored the code."

## 3. The "Voice" Check
Before publishing, read it aloud.
*   Does it sound like a person talking to a friend? -> **Keep**.
*   Does it sound like a Linkedin post? -> **Rewrite**.
