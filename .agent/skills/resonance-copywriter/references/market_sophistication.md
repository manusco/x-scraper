# Market Sophistication Protocol (E5 CAMP)

> **Source**: Todd Brown / Eugene Schwartz
> **Objective**: Determine *how* to position the offer based on what the market has already heard.
> **Rule**: "If you shout a Level 1 promise in a Level 5 market, you are invisible."

## The 5 Levels of Sophistication

### Level 1: The Promise (Blue Ocean)
*   **Context**: You are the first. The market has never heard of this solution.
*   **Strategy**: State the Benefit clearly.
*   **Headline**: "How to [Benefit]" or "[Benefit] in [Timeframe]".
*   **Example**: "Lose Weight."

### Level 2: The Expanded Promise
*   **Context**: Competition exists. Others are making the Level 1 claim.
*   **Strategy**: Expand the claim. Push it to the absolute limit.
*   **Headline**: "How to [Benefit] in [Record Time] without [Pain]".
*   **Example**: "Lose 10 Pounds in 10 Days."

### Level 3: The Unique Mechanism (The "How")
*   **Context**: The market is skeptical. They've heard the big claims and been burned.
*   **Strategy**: Stop selling the *promise*. Sell the *mechanism* that delivers the promise.
*   **Headline**: " The [Unique Mechanism] that [Delivers Benefit]".
*   **Example**: "The Ketogenic Mechanism that burns fat for fuel."

### Level 4: The Expanded Mechanism
*   **Context**: Competitors are copying your mechanism.
*   **Strategy**: Expand on the mechanism. Make it faster, easier, or more potent.
*   **Headline**: "The New [Mechanism 2.0] for [Benefit]".
*   **Example**: "Dirty Keto: The easier way to burn fat."

### Level 5: Identification (The "Bond")
*   **Context**: The market is "Dead". They don't believe claims or mechanisms.
*   **Strategy**: Shift from the product to the *prospect*. Validate their pain. Identity-based marketing.
*   **Headline**: "For the [Identity] who has tried everything...".
*   **Example**: "For the busy mom who has zero time to cook."

## Implementation Checklist

Before writing copy, determine the Level:

1.  [ ] **Competitor Scan**: What claims are currently saturating the market?
2.  [ ] **Skepticism Check**: Does the market believe the Level 1 promise? (If no, move to Level 3).
3.  [ ] **Mechanism Design**: If Level 3+, name the "Unique Mechanism" (e.g., "The Neural-Link Method").
4.  [ ] **Adjustment**:
    *   **Level 1-2**: Focus on the **RESULT**.
    *   **Level 3-4**: Focus on the **METHOD**.
    *   **Level 5**: Focus on the **PERSON**.
