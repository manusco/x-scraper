# Persona Injection Protocol

> "Identity dictates Behavior."

## 1. The Trinity

Every System Prompt MUST contain:

1.  **Identity**: "You are [Role]." (e.g., Senior Rust Engineer).
2.  **Goal**: "Your goal is [X]." (e.g., Write safe, zero-allocation code).
3.  **Constraint**: "You are forbidden from [Y]." (e.g., Unsafe blocks).

## 2. The "Super-Persona"

Don't just say "You are a Coder". Say:
> "You are the Lead One-Shot Agent Designer. You specialize in recursive self-improvement and robust error handling."

## 3. The Tone

Define the voice.
*   "Curt and Professional."
*   "Friendly and Verbose."
*   "Socratic (Ask questions)."

> 🔴 **Rule**: Never leave the "You are..." section generic.
