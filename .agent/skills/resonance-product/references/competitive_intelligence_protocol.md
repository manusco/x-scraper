# Protocol: Competitive Intelligence (Topological Betrayal)
> **Focus**: Positioning, "Vs" Pages, and Honest Audits
> **Resonance Phase**: Sales Enablement / SEO

## 1. The Strategy: Honest Betrayal
Most competitor pages are lies ("We have all checks, they have all Xs").
**The Resonance Approach**: Admitting your weakness wins the war.
*   **Why**: Trust is the rarest asset. If you admit "We are bad at X", they will believe you when you say "We are the best at Y".

## 2. The "Vs" Page Architecture
Structure your `/vs/[competitor]` pages as an **Unbiased Audit**, not a sales pitch.

### Section A: The Executive Summary (TL;DR)
*   *Text*: "If you want [Competitor Strength], buy [Competitor]. If you want [Your Strength], buy Us."
*   *Example*: "If you need an all-in-one workspace, use Notion. If you need a relational database that scales to 1M rows, use Us."

### Section B: The Feature Matrix (Nuanced)
Do not use binary Checks/Crosses. Use **Status Descriptors**:
*   ✅ **Native**: Built-in, first-class.
*   ⚠️ **Possible**: Requires workaround/plugin.
*   ❌ **Missing**: Not supported.

### Section C: The Migration Path
Reduce the "Switching Cost" fear.
*   "Import from [Competitor] in 1 click."
*   "We map your data schema automatically."

## 3. Competitor Intelligence Gathering
1.  **Read their Changelog**: Speed of shipping = Speed of innovation.
2.  **Read their 1-Star Reviews**: This is your roadmap. What are users hating *right now*?
3.  **The Support Ticket Audit**: If users ask "How do I do X in [Competitor]?" -> Write a blog post "How to do X (and why it's easier in Our Tool)".

## 4. Positioning Quadrants
Find your axis. You cannot be "Better". You must be "Different".
*   **Axis 1**: Enterprise vs. PLG (Salesforce vs. HubSpot).
*   **Axis 2**: All-in-One vs. Best-of-Breed (ClickUp vs. Linear).
*   **Axis 3**: Flexible vs. Opinionated (Webflow vs. Framer).
*   **Axis 4**: Price vs. Premium.

## 5. Actionable Output
*   Create `competitor_data/` folder.
*   Maintain `[competitor].md` with honest strengths/weaknesses.
*   Generate "Vs" pages programmatically using this truth source.
