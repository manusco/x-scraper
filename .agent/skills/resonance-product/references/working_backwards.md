**Write this BEFORE writing code.**

*   **Heading**: Name the product in a way the customer understands.
*   **Sub-Heading**: Describe the customer and the benefit.
*   **Summary**: 2-3 sentences. What is it? Why do we need it?
*   **Problem**: Describe the current pain.
*   **Solution**: Describe how this product fixes the pain.
*   **Quote**: A fake quote from a user. "I used to struggle with X, now Y makes it easy."
*   **Call to Action**: "Available today at..."

## 2. The FAQ

**Answer the hard questions now.**

*   **External**: "How much does it cost?", "Does it work offline?"
*   **Internal**: "Is this a breaking change?", "What is the P99 latency requirement?"

## 3. The Visual

*   **Napkin Sketch**: A rough UI drawing.
