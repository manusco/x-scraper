# Protocol: Pricing Architecture
> **Focus**: Monetization Logic & Value Metrics
> **Resonance Phase**: Business Model Design

## 1. The Pricing Axiom
Price is not a number. Price is a **Language**. It tells the user what you value.
*   **Axiom**: Your "Value Metric" must perfectly correlate with the User's "Success Metric".
*   *Bad*: Charging per user for a file storage app (Files don't care about users).
*   *Good*: Charging per GB for a file storage app.

## 2. The Value Metric Selection
Choose ONE metric to scale on.
1.  **Per Seat**: Only if "More People = More Value" (e.g., Slack, Jira).
2.  **Per Unit (API/GB)**: Only if "More Usage = More Value" (e.g., AWS, Twilio).
3.  **Per Feature (Tiers)**: Only if "Feature X = High Leverage" (e.g., SSO for Enterprise).
4.  **Flat Rate**: Only for "Peace of Mind" / Simple Utilities (e.g., Basecamp).

## 3. The 3-Tier Architecture (Good-Better-Best)
The human brain creates relativity when judging value.
*   **Tier 1: The Decoy (Anchor)**.
    *   *Role*: To make Tier 2 look like a bargain.
    *   *Features*: Basic. High friction.
*   **Tier 2: The Target (Winner)**.
    *   *Role*: Where you want 80% of users.
    *   *Visuals*: "Recommended" badge. Highlighted column.
    *   *Psychology*: "For just $10 more than Basic, I get Everything."
*   **Tier 3: The Ceiling (Enterprise)**.
    *   *Role*: To capture consumer surplus from price-insensitive buyers.
    *   *Features*: Compliance, SLA, Dedicated Support.
    *   *Price*: "Contact Sales" or $499+.

## 4. Van Westendorp Analysis (The 4 Questions)
Do not guess prices. Ask 10 customers:
1.  **Too Cheap**: At what price is it so cheap you doubt the quality?
2.  **Bargain**: At what price is it a great deal?
3.  **Expensive**: At what price is it pricey but you'd still buy?
4.  **Too Expensive**: At what price is it out of the question?
**Result**: The "Optimal Price Band" is between the *Bargain* and *Expensive* curves.

## 5. Pricing Psychology Patterns
*   **Charm Pricing**: $49 converts better than $50 (Left-digit effect).
*   **Annual Pre-payment**: Offer "2 Months Free" instead of "16% Off". (Tangible vs Abstract).
*   **Reframing**: Break down high costs. "$1200/year" -> "$3/day (less than coffee)".
