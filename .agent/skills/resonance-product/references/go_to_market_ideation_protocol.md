# Protocol: Go-To-Market (GTM) Vectors
> **Focus**: Growth Channels, Ideation, & Distribution
> **Resonance Phase**: Strategy Selection

## 1. The Vector Theory
Do not try 140 ideas. Pick **3 Vectors** and master them.
*   **Vector A (High Intent)**: Capturing existing demand (SEO, Ads).
*   **Vector B (High Viral)**: Creating new demand (loops, social).
*   **Vector C (High Trust)**: Borrowing credibility (Partnerships, PR).

## 2. Vector A: Engineering as Marketing (The Resonance Specialty)
Don't write a whitepaper. Build a tool.
*   **Concept**: Create a free, standalone utility that solves a specific pain point *upstream* of your product.
*   **Examples**:
    *   *HubSpot*: Website Grader.
    *   *Shopify*: Business Name Generator.
    *   *Resonance*: The "Manifesto" Generator.
*   **Execution**:
    1.  Identify a high-volume search query ("calculate roas").
    2.  Build a React component (calculator).
    3.  Gate the "Advanced Report" behind an email capture.

## 3. Vector B: The Media Company Integration
Every modern company is a media company.
*   **The Founder Brand**: People buy from people. Founder builds in public on X/LinkedIn.
*   **The Data Report**: Use your proprietary data to publish "State of the Industry" reports. (Journalists love data).
*   **The Glossary Strategy**: Define every term in your industry. Own the definitions (SEO dominance).

## 4. Vector C: The Integration Ecosystem
Embed yourself in the workflow of giants.
*   **Strategy**: "Parasitic Growth".
*   **Tactic**: Build a plugin for the ecosystem where your users already live (Chrome Extension, Slack App, Shopify App).
*   **Benefit**: You get free distribution via their App Store.

## 5. The "Idea Filter" (Kill Mechanism)
Before executing a marketing idea, run it through the **ICE Score**:
1.  **Impact (1-10)**: If it works, how big is the lift?
2.  **Confidence (1-10)**: How sure are we it will work?
3.  **Ease (1-10)**: How fast can we ship it?
*   `Score = (I * C * E)`. Sort by Score. Execute top 3.

## 6. Curated List of High-Leverage Tactics
(Adapted for Engineering Teams)
*   **Programmatic SEO**: Generate 1,000 pages from 1 database (e.g., "Best tool for [X]").
*   **Open Source Modules**: Release a distinct part of your codebase as OSS to gain developer trust.
*   **Docs as SEO**: Write documentation so good it ranks for "How to solve [Problem]".
