# Opportunity Solution Tree (The Discovery Protocol)

> "Don't fall in love with the solution. Fall in love with the problem."

## 1. The Structure

Visualizing the path from Outcome to Code.

```
1. BUSINESS OUTCOME (The Goal)
   └── "Increase Retention by 10%"
       │
       ├── 2. OPPORTUNITY (The User Pain)
       │   ├── "I can't find my old files"
       │   └── "The dashboard is too slow"
       │       │
       │       ├── 3. SOLUTION (The Idea)
       │       │   ├── "Add Search Bar"
       │       │   └── "Add Recent Files Widget"
       │       │       │
       │       │       └── 4. ASSUMPTION EXPERIMENT (The Test)
       │       │           └── "Mockup Test (1 day)"
```

## 2. The Mandate

*   **Never start at Level 3 (Solution).**
*   Always ask: "What Opportunity does this address?"
*   Always ask: "What Outcome does that Opportunity drive?"

## 3. RICE Scoring (Prioritization)

When choosing between Solutions:

**(Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort = Score**

*   **Reach**: How many people will verify this?
*   **Impact**: 3 (Massive), 2 (High), 1 (Medium), 0.5 (Low).
*   **Confidence**: 100% (High), 80% (Medium), 50% (Low).
*   **Effort**: Person-Weeks.
