# Pirate Metrics (AARRR) Protocol

> "Vanity metrics make you feel good. Pirate metrics make you rich."

## 1. The Funnel

Measure users, not hits.

| Metric | Business Component | Example KPI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A**cquisition | "How do they find us?" | Social Clicks, SEO Traffic. |
| **A**ctivation | "Do they have a great first experience?" | Signups, "Aha Moment", First Post. |
| **R**etention | "Do they come back?" | DAU/MAU, Churn Rate, N-Day Retention. |
| **R**eferral | "Do they tell others?" | K-Factor, Shares, Invites. |
| **R**evenue | "How do we make money?" | LTV, ARPU, Conversion Rate. |

## 2. The Mandate

*   **Rule**: Never optimize Acquisition before Activation. (Don't pour water into a leaky bucket).
*   **Focus**: Identify the **OMTM** (One Metric That Matters). Ignore the rest.

## 3. The Activation Standard ("The Aha Moment")

You must define the exact moment a user gets value.
*   **Slack**: 2000 messages sent.
*   **Facebooks**: 7 friends in 10 days.
*   **Dropbox**: 1 file in folder.
