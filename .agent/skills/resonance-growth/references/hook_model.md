# The Hook Model (Habit Formation)

> "To change behavior, you must create a habit."
> — Nir Eyal

## 1. The 4-Step Cycle

1.  **TRIGGER** (Internal/External)
    *   **External**: Push Notification, Email.
    *   **Internal**: Boredom, Fear of Missing Out (FOMO), Loneliness.
    *   *Goal*: Move from External triggers to Internal habits.

2.  **ACTION** (The Behavior)
    *   Must be simpler than thinking.
    *   **Fogg Model**: `Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt`.
    *   *Standard*: < 2 clicks to get reward.

3.  **VARIABLE REWARD** (The Slot Machine)
    *   Do not give the same reward every time.
    *   **Types**:
        *   **Tribe**: Likes, social validation.
        *   **Hunt**: Information, resources.
        *   **Self**: Mastery, completion.

4.  **INVESTMENT** (The Lock-in)
    *   User does work to improve *future* experience.
    *   Examples: Following a user, Uploading data, Customizing profile.

## 2. The Mandate

*   **Audit**: Map your core feature to this loop.
*   **Fail Condition**: If there is no "Investment", the user will churn.
