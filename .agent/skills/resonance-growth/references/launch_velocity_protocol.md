# Protocol: Launch Velocity Architecture
> **Focus**: Momentum Engineering & Event Strategy
> **Resonance Phase**: Go-to-Market (GTM)

## 1. The Launch Fallacy
A launch is not a "Day". A launch is a "Function of Velocity over Time".
*   **Bad Launch**: Spike -> Crash.
*   **Good Launch**: Staircase Function (Step-up -> Sustain -> Step-up).

## 2. The ORB Framework (Channel Strategy)
1.  **Owned (The Asset)**: Email List, Blog. (Highest conversion, Low Scale).
2.  **Rented (The Amplifier)**: Product Hunt, X, LinkedIn. (High Scale, Low Retention).
3.  **Borrowed (The Validation)**: Influencers, Guest Posts. (Trust Transfer).

## 3. The Sequence (Countdown to Lift-off)

### T-Minus 14 Days: The Hype (Build Pressure)
*   **Objective**: Email Collection.
*   **Tactic**: "Something is coming." Teaser screenshots.
*   **Waitlist Goal**: 1,000 Signups.

### T-Zero: The Event (Release Pressure)
*   **Platform**: Product Hunt + Social Blitz.
*   **Mechanism**: 
    1.  Email the Waitlist: "We are live. Upvote here."
    2.  Reply to every comment within 5 minutes (Algorithmic boost).
    3.  Social Proof injection: "We are Trending #1."

### T-Plus 7 Days: The Echo (Sustain)
*   **Objective**: Case Studies.
*   **Tactic**: "Look what User X built in Week 1."
*   **Mechanism**: Retargeting Ads to "Launch Day Visitors".

## 4. Launch Types

### The Beta Launch (Scarcity)
*   **Focus**: Feedback.
*   **Tactic**: Invite Codes. "Only 5 invites per user". VIP access.

### The Rolling Launch (Feature Drops)
*   **Focus**: Retention.
*   **Tactic**: "Ship It Weekly". Every Friday is a mini-launch.

## 5. The "Dead Zone" Recovery
If launch fails (Vectors < Target):
1.  **Pivot Angle**: Change the H1.
2.  **Change Audience**: Rented Channel shift (e.g., from PH to Reddit).
3.  **Lower Friction**: Remove Credit Card requirement.
