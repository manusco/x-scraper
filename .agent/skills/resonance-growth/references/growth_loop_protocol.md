# Protocol: Growth Loop Engineering
> **Focus**: Viral Mechanics & K-Factor Optimization
> **Resonance Phase**: Scaling / Virality

## 1. The Growth Axiom
Growth is not a "Funnel" (Linear). Growth is a "Loop" (Circular).
**The Equation**: `One User` -> `Action` -> `New User`.

## 2. The Viral Coefficient ($K$)
You must engineer systems where $K > 1$.
*   $K = (\text{Invites per User}) \times (\text{Conversion Rate})$.
*   *If $K > 1$:* Exponential Growth.
*   *If $K < 1$:* Linear Decay.

## 3. Loop Architecture Pattern

### Type A: The Utility Loop (Dropbox)
*   **Mechanism**: "I cannot use this product alone."
*   **Trigger**: User invites colleague to collaborate on a doc.
*   **Incentive**: Free Storage / Unlocked features.
*   **Action**: `Invite` button is the primary CTA of the dashboard.

### Type B: The Value Loop (Airbnb)
*   **Mechanism**: "My usage creates value for others."
*   **Trigger**: Host lists an apartment -> Guest sees listing -> Guest joins.
*   **Action**: SEO pages generated by user intent.

### Type C: The Financial Loop (PayPal/Uber)
*   **Mechanism**: "We both get paid."
*   **Trigger**: "Give $10, Get $10".
*   **Constraint**: Valid only if $CAC < LTV$.

## 4. Engineering The "Share" Component
1.  **The Contextual Prompt**: Don't ask "Invite a Friend" in the settings. Ask it *after* a "High-Dopamine Event" (e.g., File Uploaded, Purchase Complete).
2.  **The Double-Sided Incentive**: Altruism is weak. Greed is reliable. Reward *both* parties.
3.  **Frictionless Transport**:
    *   `mailto:` links with pre-filled body.
    *   One-click WhatsApp share.
    *   Copy Link button (with feedback toast).

## 5. Fraud Guardrails
If you pay for growth, you attract mercenaries.
*   **Velocity Checks**: Max 10 referrals/hour.
*   **Device Fingerprinting**: Ban multiple accounts on same IP/Device.
*   **Activation Lock**: Pay reward only *after* the referred user spends $1.
