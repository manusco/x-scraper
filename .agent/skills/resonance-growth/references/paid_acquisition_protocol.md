# Protocol: Paid Acquisition (Arbitrage Engineering)
> **Focus**: ROAS Optimization & Ad Economics
> **Resonance Phase**: Scaling / Paid

## 1. The Arbitrage Equation
Paid Ads are simple: **Buy $1.00 of Revenue for $0.80.**
*   If $LTV > 3 \times CAC$: **Scale aggressively.**
*   If $LTV < CAC$: **Stop. Fix Product/Offer.**

## 2. Platform Selection Logic
*   **Google (Intent)**: "I want to buy X." (High Conversion, High Cost).
    *   *Use for*: Bottom of Funnel.
*   **Meta/IG (Pattern Matching)**: "I look like people who buy X." (Visual, Scale).
    *   *Use for*: Top of Funnel / Demand Gen.
*   **LinkedIn (Demographic)**: "I am a CTO." (B2B, Very High Cost).
    *   *Use for*: Enterprise/High-Ticket only.

## 3. Campaign Structure (The 70/20/10 Rule)
*   **70% Budget**: Proven Winners. (Evergreen campaigns).
*   **20% Budget**: Safe Experiments. (New angles on winning audiences).
*   **10% Budget**: Moonshots. (New platforms, wild creatives).

## 4. Creative Strategy: PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve)
Ad Creative is 80% of the performance lever (Targeting is automated by AI).
1.  **The Hook (Problem)**: "Stop updating spreadsheets." (Visual: Red X).
2.  **The Agitation**: "It costs you 10 hours a week."
3.  **The Solution**: "Click here to automate."
4.  **The CTA**: "Try Free."

## 5. The Retargeting Trap
Do not burn money showing ads to people who already bought.
*   **Exclusion Lists**: Sync Stripe "Paid Users" to Ad Account daily.
*   **Frequency Cap**: Max 3 impressions/day. Don't be annoying.

## 6. Landing Page Alignment (Message Match)
The Ad and the Landing Page must be twins.
*   *Ad Text*: "Automate your Taxes."
*   *Landing Page H1*: "Automate your Taxes."
*   *Failure*: Ad says "Taxes", Page says "Welcome to our Platform". -> Bounce.
