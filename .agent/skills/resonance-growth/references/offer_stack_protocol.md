# Offer Stack Protocol (The "Value Anchor")

> **Source**: Russell Brunson / ClickFunnels
> **Objective**: Make the price irrelevant by stacking massive perceived value.
> **Rule**: "The value of the offer must be at least 10x the price."

## 1. The Core Offer Equation
`Value = (Dream Outcome x Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay x Effort & Sacrifice)`

To increase value, we must:
1.  Increase the Dream (The Big Promise).
2.  Increase Belief (Proof, Logic, "Unique Mechanism").
3.  Decrease Time (Speed to Result).
4.  Decrease Effort (Done-For-You, Templates).

## 2. The Stack Slide Checklist
When presenting an offer (LP or Email), ensure these elements exist:

- [ ] **The Core Product**: What they are actually buying.
- [ ] **Bonus #1 (The Problem Solver)**: Solves the *immediate* next problem they face after buying.
- [ ] **Bonus #2 (The Accelerator)**: Helps them get the result faster (Checklists, Templates).
- [ ] **Bonus #3 (The Risk Reversal)**: A guarantee that removes all risk.
- [ ] **Total Value Anchor**: "Total Value: $X,XXX" (Must be real value).
- [ ] **The Price Drop**: "But you pay only $XX".

## 3. Risk Reversal Architecture
A guarantee is not just a refund policy. It is a sales tool.

### Level 1: The Standard
"30-Day Money Back Guarantee." (Boring).

### Level 2: The Conditional (The "Action Taker")
"If you do the work and don't get the result, I will refund you + $100 for wasting your time." (High trust).

### Level 3: The Unconditional (The "No Brainer")
"Love it or keep it. If you aren't thrilled, email us and we'll refund you. You don't even have to return the product."

## 4. Implementation Sanity Check
- **Does the offer feel "heavy"?** (Too many PDFs, not enough tools).
- **Does the bonus solve a NEW problem?** (Don't solve the same problem twice).
- **Is the scarcity real?** (Don't fake countdown timers).
