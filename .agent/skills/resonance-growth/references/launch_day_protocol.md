# Launch Day Protocol

> **Objective**: Generate momentum that compounds. "Launch again and again."

## 1. The ORB Framework (Channel Strategy)
*   **Owned (Primary)**: Email, Blog, Discord. (High Control, High Asset Value).
*   **Rented (Visibility)**: Twitter, LinkedIn, Product Hunt. (High Reach, Low Control).
*   **Borrowed (Trust)**: Influencers, Guest Posts. (High Trust, Low Cost).

## 2. The 5-Phase Sequence
1.  **Internal**: Friendly users only. Fix blockers.
2.  **Alpha**: "Early Access" landing page. Validate basics.
3.  **Beta**: Invite waitlist. Leak screenshots ("Building in public").
4.  **Early Access**: Throttle invites (FOMO). Gather testimonials.
5.  **Full Launch**: Open gates. Product Hunt. Lightning strike.
