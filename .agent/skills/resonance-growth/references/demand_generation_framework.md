# Demand Generation Framework (Capture vs. Create)

> **Source**: Scaling Demand Systems
> **Objective**: Distinguish between harvesting existing intent and manufacturing new desire.
> **Rule**: "You cannot capture demand that does not exist."

## 1. The Demand Matrix

| Mode | State of Prospect | Channel Strategy | Content Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Capture** | "High Intent" (Searching) | SEO, PPC (Search), retargeting | Technical, Pricing, Comparisons ("X vs Y") |
| **Create** | "Low/Zero Intent" (Browsing) | Social Ads, Display, Virality, PR | Narrative, Problem-Agitation, "Did you know?" |

## 2. The Nurture Sequence (Mofu/Bofu)
Once attention is captured, it must be bridged to the offer.

### Phase 1: Consumption (Hello)
*   **Goal**: Get them to consume *one* deep piece of content.
*   **Format**: Long-form Video, Whitepaper, Webinar.
*   **Metric**: Time on Site / Video Completion %.

### Phase 2: Indoctrination (Belief)
*   **Goal**: Shift their beliefs to align with your "Unique Mechanism".
*   **Format**: Case Studies, "Myth Busting" emails, Behind the Scenes.

### Phase 3: Conversion (Offer)
*   **Goal**: The Ask.
*   **Format**: The Offer Stack, Scarcity, Direct Sales.

## 3. The "Content Multiplication" Protocol
Don't create once. Multiply.
1.  **Core Asset**: 1x Deep Dive (YouTube Video / Long Blog).
2.  **Splinters**:
    *   3x Short Clips (TikTok/Shorts).
    *   1x Newsletter (Summary).
    *   5x Tweets/LinkedIn Posts (Quotes/Hooks).
    *   1x Graphic (Framework/Chart).

## 4. Campaign Checklist
- [ ] **Traffic**: Are we capturing (Search) or generating (Social)?
- [ ] **Bridge**: Is there a clear path from Ad -> Content -> Offer?
- [ ] **Follow-up**: Do we have a 5-day email sequence for non-buyers?
