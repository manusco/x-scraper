# Core Loop Psychology

> We do not code mechanics. We code *dopamine triggers*.

## 1. The Compulsion Loop

A player will repeat an action forever if the loop is tight enough.

**The Cycle:**
1.  **Anticipation (The Cue)**: Seeing an enemy, seeing a resource node.
2.  **Action (The Skill)**: Aiming, jumping, timing a click.
3.  **Variable Reward (The Dopamine)**: Loot drop (Randomness is key).
4.  **Investment (The Hook)**: Using loot to upgrade stats (Making the next loop easier).

> 🔴 **Design Rule**: If there is no "Investment" phase, the player will churn.

## 2. Flow State (Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi)

The "Zone" happens when:
**Skill Level ≈ Challenge Level**

*   **Boredom**: High Skill, Low Challenge.
*   **Anxiety**: Low Skill, High Challenge.
*   **Flow**: Balanced.

**Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA)**:
*   If player dies too fast → Spawn Health Potion.
*   If player takes no damage → Spawn Elite Enemy.

## 3. Self-Determination Theory (SDT)

Players are motivated by 3 needs:
1.  **Autonomy**: "I chose to go here." (Open World vs Corridor).
2.  **Competence**: "I am getting better." (Level up, damage numbers go up).
3.  **Relatedness**: "I matter to this world." (NPCs react, Multiplayer).

## 4. Monetization Ethics

| Strategy | Verdict | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pay-to-Win** | **BANNED** | Destroys "Competence". Wins feel bought, not earned. |
| **Loot Boxes** | **BANNED** | Predatory gambling mechanics. |
| **Cosmetics** | **APPROVED** | Increases "Autonomy" (Self-expression). |
| **Skip Time** | **CAUTION** | Suggests your game is boring and worth skipping. |
| **Battle Pass** | **APPROVED** | Synchronizes community "Relatedness". |
