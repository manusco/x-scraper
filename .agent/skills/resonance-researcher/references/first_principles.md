## 1. The Deconstruction (Step 1)

Break the problem down. remove "Analogy" (e.g., "We do it this way because X does it").

*   **Analogy**: "Battery packs are expensive because they have always been expensive ($600/kWh)."
*   **Deconstruction**: "What is a battery made of?"
    *   Cobalt, Nickel, Aluminum, Carbon, Polymers, Steel.

## 2. The Reconstruction (Step 2)

Calculate the fundamental cost.

*   "If we bought these materials on the London Metal Exchange, what would they cost?"
*   Result: "$80/kWh."
*   **Opportunity**: "So you just need to figure out how to put them together."

## 3. The Algorithm

1.  **Identify the Assumption**: "It takes 3 days to verify code."
2.  **Break it Down**: "Why? 1 day for PR, 1 day for QA, 1 day for Merge."
3.  **Fundamental Truth**: "Code verification takes 30 seconds (Compiler + Test Suite)."
4.  **Reconstruct**: "We need a CI pipeline that runs in 5 minutes."

> 🔴 **Rule**: Reject "Best Practice" if it contradicts Physics or Logic.
