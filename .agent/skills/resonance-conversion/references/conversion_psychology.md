# Conversion Psychology Patterns

> **Objective**: Understand and influence user behavior ethically.

## 1. The Fogg Behavior Model
**Formula**: `Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Trigger`

### High Motivation strategies:
- **Scarcity**: "Only 3 spots left."
- **Urgency**: "Offer ends in 24h."

### High Ability strategies (Friction Removal):
- **Defaults**: Pre-check standard options.
- **Visual Cues**: Arrows pointing to CTA.
- **Single Column**: Linear path, no distraction.

## 2. The 6 Principles of Influence (Cialdini)
1.  **Reciprocity**: Give value first (Free Tool/PDF) -> Ask for email.
2.  **Commitment**: "Start Free" (Low friction) -> "Upgrade" (High friction).
3.  **Social Proof**: "Joined by 10,000+ developers" (Logos > Text).
4.  **Authority**: "Verified by Google" / Badges.
5.  **Liking**: Clean, aesthetic design = Trust.
6.  **Scarcity**: Real limitations only (Don't fake timers).

## 3. Friction Audits (The "Grind" Check)
- [ ] **Field Count**: every extra field = -10% conversion.
- [ ] **Captcha**: Never use on landing pages (unless spammed).
- [ ] **Load Time**: > 2s = -40% bounce.
