# A/B Testing Rigor Protocol

> "Opinion is the enemy of revenue."

## 1. The Hypothesis

Never "just test it". Write the hypothesis.
*   **Formula**: "If we [Change X], then [Metric Y] will increase because [Reason Z]."
*   **Example**: "If we move the Pricing Table above the Fold, Signups will increase because users are price-sensitive."

## 2. Statistical Significance

Do not stop the test early.
*   **Minimum Sample**: Usually ~1000 conversions per variant.
*   **Confidence**: 95% (p < 0.05).
*   **Tool**: Use a Calculator (Evan Miller). Do not eyeball it.

## 3. The "One Thing" Rule

Test ONE variable at a time.
*   ❌ Change Headline + Button Color + Layout. (Multivariate is complex).
*   ✅ Change Headline only.

> 🔴 **Rule**: A "Failed" test is a success if you learned *why* it failed.
