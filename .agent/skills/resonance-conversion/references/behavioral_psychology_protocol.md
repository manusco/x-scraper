# Protocol: Behavioral Engineering (Psychology)
> **Focus**: Cognitive Biases & Decision Architecture
> **Resonance Phase**: Conversion / Strategy

## 1. The Human Operating System
We do not "persuade"; we align with existing cognitive architecture.
**Core Axiom**: `Behavior = Motivation x Ability x Prompt` (Fogg).

## 2. The Cognitive Bias Library (The API)

### A. Decision Heuristics (Quick Thinking)
1.  **Social Proof (Consensus)**: "Others are doing it, so it's safe."
    *   *Implementation*: `Use Numbers`. "Joined by 10,000 engineers" > "Popular".
2.  **Scarcity (Loss Aversion)**: "If I don't act, I lose."
    *   *Implementation*: `Definite Limits`. "3 seats left" or "Offer ends Tuesday".
3.  **Authority (Credibility)**: "The expert says it's good."
    *   *Implementation*: `Badges`. "ISO 27001 Certified", "Ex-Google Founders".

### B. Value Perception (Pricing)
1.  **Anchoring**: The first number dictates the value.
    *   *Pattern*: Show the $2,000 Enterprise plan *before* the $50 Pro plan.
2.  **Decoy Effect**: Add an asymmetrical option to force a choice.
    *   *Pattern*: Small ($3), Medium ($6.50), Large ($7). Taking Large is "logical".

### C. The Friction Layer
1.  **The IKEA Effect**: Users value what they build.
    *   *Pattern*: Let them configure the dashboard *during* onboarding.
2.  **Sunk Cost**: They won't leave if they invested data.
    *   *Pattern*: "Import your history" as step 1.

## 3. Engineering "The Nudge"
A Nudge is a default choice architecture that alters behavior without forbidding options.

*   **Defaults**: The most powerful force. Checkboxes should be `checked` (if ethical) or options `pre-selected`.
*   **Visual Hierarchy**: The "Primary Button" is 3x the weight of the "Secondary Link".

## 4. Emotional Debugging
If a user is not converting, debug the emotion using the **5 Whys**.
*   *Why?* "Too expensive."
*   *Why?* "Don't see the ROI."
*   *Why?* "Don't trust the calculator."
*   *Fix*: Improve the calculator's UX, not the price.

## 5. Ethical Bounds (The Safety Rail)
We use psychology to help users make the decision *they already want to make*.
*   **Dark Patterns**: Banned. (e.g., Hidden unsubscribe, forced continuity).
*   **Transparency**: Radical honesty builds higher LTV than trickery.
