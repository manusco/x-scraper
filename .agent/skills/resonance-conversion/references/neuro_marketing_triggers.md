# Neuro-Marketing Triggers Protocol

> "We don't buy with logic. We buy with emotion and justify with logic."

## 1. The Anchoring Effect

Price perception is relative.
*   **Tactic**: Show the "Enterprise Plan" ($999) first.
*   **Result**: The "Pro Plan" ($49) feels cheap.

## 2. The Bandwagon Effect (Social Proof)

"Everyone else is doing it."
*   **Tactic**: "Join 10,000+ developers."
*   **Tactic**: Real-time popups ("Someone in London just bought...").

## 3. Loss Aversion

We fear losing $100 more than we love gaining $100.
*   **Weak**: "Save $50."
*   **Strong**: "Stop losing $50 every month."

## 4. Zero Risk Bias

We love certainty.
*   **Tactic**: "100% Free Trial. No Credit Card Required."
*   **Tactic**: "Cancel anytime."

> 🔴 **Rule**: Use these ethically. Do not manipulate; persuade.
