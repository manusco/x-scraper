# Protocol: Page Conversion Architecture (CRO)
> **Focus**: Landing Page Engineering
> **Resonance Phase**: Conversion / Optimization

## 1. The 3-Second Compile
A landing page must "compile" in the user's brain in < 3 seconds.
**Passing Criteria**:
1.  **Who are you?** (Logo/Name)
2.  **What do you do?** (H1 Headline)
3.  **Why should I care?** (Sub-headline / Value Prop)

## 2. The LIFT Model Analysis
Optimize these 6 vectors to increase conversion probability ($P$).

1.  **Value Proposition (The Core)**: The vehicle of value.
    *   *Fix*: Is it clear? Is it unique?
2.  **Clarity (The Lens)**: No jargon.
    *   *Audit*: Can a 10-year-old explain it?
3.  **Relevance (The Map)**: Does the H1 match the Ad they clicked?
    *   *Fix*: Message Match.
4.  **Urgency (The Fuel)**: Why now?
    *   *Fix*: Countdowns, Cohort starts, Limited Beta.
5.  **Anxiety (The Drag)**: What are they afraid of?
    *   *Fix*: "No Credit Card Required", "Cancel Anytime".
6.  **Distraction (The Friction)**: Remove navigation.
    *   *Fix*: Kill the Navbar on Landing Pages.

## 3. The Structural Blueprint

### Section 1: The Hero (The Promise)
*   **H1**: Benefit-driven.
*   **Hero Shot**: Visualize the product (UI Screenshot or Video).
*   **Primary CTA**: High contrast button.

### Section 2: Social Proof (The Tribe)
*   **Logos**: "Trusted by..."
*   **Testimonial**: Specific outcomes. "$10k saved" > "Great tool".

### Section 3: The "How It Works" (The Logic)
*   **Step 1-2-3**: Simplify complexity into linear steps.

### Section 4: The Offer (The Closing)
*   **Guarantee**: Risk Reversal.
*   **FAQ**: Handle objections.
*   **Final CTA**: One last chance.

## 4. Optimization Heuristics
*   **The Fold is a Myth**: But the *Header* is reality. Put the hook at the top.
*   **F-Pattern Reading**: Users scan in an F-shape. Put keywords on the left.
*   **Button Copy**: "Get X" > "Submit".

## 5. A/B Testing Discipline
Do not guess. Test.
*   **Variable**: Change ONE thing (Headline OR Button Color).
*   **Significance**: Wait for 95% confidence.
*   **Sample Size**: Don't conclude on 10 conversions.
