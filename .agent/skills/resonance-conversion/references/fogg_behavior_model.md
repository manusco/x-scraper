# Fogg Behavior Model (B=MAT) Protocol

> "Behavior happens when Motivation, Ability, and a Trigger come together at the same moment."
> — Dr. BJ Fogg

## 1. The Formula

**B = M + A + T**

*   **Motivation**: High or Low. (How much do they want it?)
*   **Ability**: Hard or Easy. (How hard is it to do?)
*   **Trigger**: The prompt. (CTA, Email, Notification).

## 2. The Relationship

*   **High Motivation** + **Hard to Do** = **Frustration**.
*   **Low Motivation** + **Easy to Do** = **Annoyance** (Spam).
*   **High Motivation** + **Easy to Do** = **Action**.

## 3. The Debugging Algorithm

**If users represent't converting, ask in this order:**

1.  **Is there a Trigger?** (Did we ask them to do it?)
    *   *Fix*: Add a clear CTA.
2.  **Is it Easy? (Ability)** (Can they do it in < 3 seconds?)
    *   *Fix*: Remove fields, remove steps, remove think-time.
3.  **Are they Motivated? (Motivation)** (Do they crave the result?)
    *   *Fix*: Increase value proposition (Copy), social proof, scarcity.

> 🔴 **Rule**: Always optimize **Ability** (make it easier) before **Motivation** (persuasion).
