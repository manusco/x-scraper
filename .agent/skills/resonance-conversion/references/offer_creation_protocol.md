# Offer Creation Protocol (Grand Slam)

> "Make an offer so good they feel stupid saying no."

## 1. The Value Equation

$$ Value = \frac{Dream \ Outcome \times Probability \ of \ Success}{Time \ Delay \times Effort \ \& \ Sacrifice} $$

*   **Dream Outcome**: Make it massive.
*   **Probability**: Show proof/guarantees.
*   **Time Delay**: Make it instant.
*   **Effort**: Do it for them ("Done For You").

## 2. The Stack (Perceived Value)

Do not sell "A Course". Sell:
1.  The Course ($997 Value)
2.  The Templates ($497 Value)
3.  The Community Access ($297 Value)
4.  **Total Value**: $1791. **Price**: $97.

## 3. Scarcity & Urgency

*   **Scarcity**: "Only 5 spots left." (Quantity).
*   **Urgency**: "Closing on Friday." (Time).
*   **Warning**: Fake urgency destroys trust. If you say it closes, CLOSE IT.

> 🔴 **Rule**: Low price is not an offer. High value is an offer.
