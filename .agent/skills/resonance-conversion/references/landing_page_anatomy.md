# Landing Page Anatomy Protocol

> "A landing page is a slippery slide. The goal of the headline is to get you to read the subheadline."

## 1. The Above-the-Fold (The Hook)

You have 3 seconds.
1.  **Headline**: The Dream Outcome (big, bold).
2.  **Subheadline**: How it works + handling the #1 objection.
3.  **CTA**: "Get Started" (Primary) and "Watch Demo" (Secondary).
4.  **Social Proof**: "Trusted by 500+ companies" (Logos).

## 2. The Narrative Arc (StoryBrand)

1.  **The Problem**: "You are tired of X." (Agitate the pain).
2.  **The Guide**: "We have solved X for 10 years." (Authority).
3.  **The Plan**: "Step 1, Step 2, Step 3." (Clarify the path).
4.  **The Failure**: "If you don't act, X will happen." (Stakes).
5.  **The Success**: "Before/After." (Visual transformation).

## 3. The Trust Battery

*   **Testimonials**: Faces + Names + Specific Outcomes.
*   **Guarantee**: "30-Day Money Back" (Risk Reversal).
*   **FAQ**: Handle the last 5 objections here.

> 🔴 **Rule**: Never talk about "Features" (e.g., "We use React"). Talk about "Benefits" (e.g., "Loads instantly").
