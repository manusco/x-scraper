# Protocol: The Friction Collider

> **"Every micro-friction is a wealth leak."**

## 1. The Physics of Friction

Friction is any force that opposes the User's motion toward the Goal. It is not an "inconvenience"; it is a **Wall**.

We classify Friction into 4 Fundamental Forces:
1.  **Cognitive Friction** (The Brain): Confusion, mental load, jargon, logical gaps.
2.  **Emotional Friction** (The Heart): Annoyance, pressure, feeling manipulated, feeling condescended to.
3.  **Visual/Kinetic Friction** (The Eyes/Hands): Clutter, hard-to-find buttons, layout shifts, formatting errors.
4.  **Trust Friction** (The Gut): Skepticism, "too good to be true", missing proof, generic vibes.

## 2. Zero-Tolerance Policy

*   **Rule:** Friction points do not get "reduced". They must be **eliminated**.
*   **The Standard:** A "Smooth Slide". The user should fall through the funnel by gravity alone.

## 3. The Collider Simulation (The 4 Sweeps)

To find friction, we do not "read" the page. We **Simulate a Collision** between a specific **Persona** and the **Interface**.

### Sweep 1: COGNITIVE (Mental Effort)
*The Persona is tired, distracted, and has low patience.*
*   **Check:**
    *   [ ] Did I have to re-read any sentence?
    *   [ ] Is there a word I don't use in daily life? (Jargon)
    *   [ ] Did I have to guess what happens next?
    *   [ ] Did I lose the "Through-Line" (the narrative thread)?
    *   [ ] **The "Wait, What?" Test**: Any point where the brain pauses is a failure.

### Sweep 2: EMOTIONAL (Negative Triggers)
*The Persona is defensive and guarding their wallet.*
*   **Check:**
    *   [ ] Do I feel talked down to?
    *   [ ] Do I feel manipulated (fake urgency, countdown timers)?
    *   [ ] Do I feel overwhelmed by choices?
    *   [ ] Do I feel "This isn't for people like me"?
    *   [ ] **The "Ugh" Test**: Any point that triggers a sigh or eye-roll is a failure.

### Sweep 3: VISUAL/KINETIC (Interface Barriers)
*The Persona is scanning, not reading. Their thumb is hovering.*
*   **Check:**
    *   [ ] Is the next step obvious without reading? (Squint Test)
    *   [ ] Is there debris (popups, banners) blocking my path?
    *   [ ] Does the form ask for data I don't want to give yet?
    *   [ ] Is the layout shifting as things load?
    *   [ ] **The "Bail" Test**: Any scroll point where the eye gets bored/lost is a bail point.

### Sweep 4: TRUST (Credibility Barriers)
*The Persona has been burned before. They assume it's a scam.*
*   **Check:**
    *   [ ] "Yeah, right." (Unbacked claims)
    *   [ ] "Who are you?" (No human face/story)
    *   [ ] "What's the catch?" (Hidden pricing/terms)
    *   [ ] "Is this a template?" (Generic stock photos)
    *   [ ] **The "Scam" Test**: Any element that feels like a "internet mraketer" tactic is a failure.

## 4. Output Format: The Debris Field

Report findings in this strict format:

| Type | The Snag (What happened?) | The Cost (What does user feel?) | The Fix (Smooth Slide) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cognitive** | "Synergistic optimization tools..." | "I don't know what this does." | "Tools to make you faster." |
| **Trust** | "Best in class." | "Prove it or shut up." | "Used by 500+ teams including [Logo]." |
