# The LIFT Model (Landing Page Audit)

> "Conversion is not luck. It is engineering."

## 1. The Core Value Proposition (The Engine)

**Why should I buy from you vs. the competitor?**
*   Must be visible in 5 seconds.
*   Must be unique.

## 2. The Factors

### Drivers (Boost Conversion)
1.  **Relevance**: Does the headline match the ad used to get here?
2.  **Clarity**: Is the offer confusing? (Confusion = No).
3.  **Urgency**: Why now? (Real deadlines, limited stock).

### Inhibitors (Kill Conversion)
1.  **Anxiety**: "Is my credit card safe?", "Will they spam me?"
    *   *Fix*: Trust badges, "No credit card required", HTTPS.
2.  **Distraction**: Anything that is NOT the primary goal.
    *   *Fix*: Remove nav bar on checkout. Remove social links.

## 3. The 6-Point Audit

1.  **Headline**: Clear benefit?
2.  **Hero Image**: Shows the product (or result)?
3.  **CTA**: High contrast color?
4.  **Forms**: Minimal fields?
5.  **Proof**: Logos/Testimonials?
6.  **Footer**: Distraction-free?
