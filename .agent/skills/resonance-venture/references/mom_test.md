# The Mom Test Protocol

> "It's not their responsibility to tell you the truth. It's your responsibility to find it."
> — Rob Fitzpatrick

## 1. The 3 Rules

1.  **Talk about their life, not your idea.**
    *   ❌ "Do you like my app?" (They will lie).
    *   ✅ "Tell me about the last time you struggled with X."

2.  **Ask about specifics in the past, not generics in the future.**
    *   ❌ "Would you pay for this?" (Hypothetical).
    *   ✅ "Have you tried to solve this before? How much did that cost?"

3.  **Talk less, listen more.**
    *   If you are pitching, you are failing.

## 2. The Signals

*   **Weak Signal**: "That sounds cool." (Polite lie).
*   **Strong Signal**: "Why isn't this fixed yet?" (Anger).
*   **Payment Signal**: "Can I pre-order?" (The Truth).

> 🔴 **Rule**: If they don't open their wallet or calendar, it's a "No".
