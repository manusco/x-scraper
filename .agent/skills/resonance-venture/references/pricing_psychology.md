# Pricing Psychology Protocol

> **Objective**: Optimize value perception through behavioral economics.

## 1. Core Principles
*   **Anchoring**: Always present the highest price first (or a "Compare at" price). This makes the standard price feel like a deal.
*   **Decoy Effect**: Add a 3rd option that makes the target option look superior.
    *   *Bad*: Small ($3), Large ($7).
    *   *Good*: Small ($3), Medium ($6.50), Large ($7). -> Everyone buys Large.

## 2. Formatting Tactics
*   **Charm Pricing**: Ends in 9 or 5 ($99 vs $100).
    *   *Exception*: Luxury goods use round numbers ($1,000).
*   **Visual Weight**: The price font size should be smaller than the value proposition font size.
*   **Center-Stage Effect**: Users gravitate to the middle option. Make it your "Recommended" plan.

## 3. The "Pain of Paying"
*   **Reduce Friction**: "Pre-pay annually" (One pain, once) vs "Monthly" (Pain every month).
*   **Reframing**: "$1/day" feels cheaper than "$30/month".
