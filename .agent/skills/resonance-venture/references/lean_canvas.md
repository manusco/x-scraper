# The Lean Canvas Protocol

> "Business Plans are dead. Models are alive."

## 1. The 9 Blocks (Order matters)

1.  **Problem**: Top 3 problems. (e.g., "Emails are too long").
2.  **Customer Segments**: Who has this pain *most*? (e.g., "CEOs").
3.  **Unique Value Prop (UVP)**: Single clear message. (e.g., "AI that summarizes email").
4.  **Solution**: Top 3 features. (e.g., "Auto-bullets").
5.  **Channels**: Path to customers. (e.g., "LinkedIn Ads").
6.  **Revenue Streams**: Cash flow. (e.g., "$10/mo SaaS").
7.  **Cost Structure**: Burn rate. (e.g., "Server costs").
8.  **Key Metrics**: What measures success? (e.g., "Summaries read per day").
9.  **Unfair Advantage**: Can't be copied. (e.g., "Proprietary Data").

## 2. The Risk Assessment

*   **Product Risk**: Can we build it?
*   **Customer Risk**: Do they want it?
*   **Market Risk**: Will they pay?

> 🔴 **Rule**: Tackle the Riskiest Assumption (RAT) first. Usually "Customer Risk".
