# Protocol: The Leverage Code

> **Objective**: Maximizing Output per Unit of Human Input.

## 1. The Core Philosophy
We do not build "Companies" (which implies organiation charts and overhead).
We build **Leverage Vehicles**.

Whether you are 1 person or 10, the rules of leverage apply:
1.  **Code Leverage**: Software works while you sleep. (SaaS, Automations).
2.  **Media Leverage**: Content creates 1-to-many relationships. (Audience, Brand).
3.  **Capital Leverage**: Using money to skip time. (Ads, Acquisition).
4.  **Labor Leverage**: (The Dangerous One). Only use when the other 3 are exhausted.

## 2. The Anti-Bloat Rules
*   **Rule 1**: If it makes less than $100k/employee, you are a charity.
*   **Rule 2**: If you can't describe the business model on a napkin, you don't have one.
*   **Rule 3**: Revenue is vanity. Profit is sanity. Cash flow is reality.

## 3. The 90-Day Sprint (The Launch)
*   **Days 0-30**: **Validation** (The Mom Test, Pre-sales). $0 Tech Stack.
*   **Days 31-60**: **Systemization** (Building the AI Delivery Pipeline).
*   **Days 61-90**: **Monetization** (Scaling the Offer).

## 4. The Offer Stack
Every High-Leverage venture needs a stacked offer:
*   **The Transformation**: What is the Before/After state?
*   **The Mechanism**: How do you bridge the gap? (AI, Code, Consulting).
*   **The Guarantee**: Reversing the risk.
