# UX Audit Protocol (Heuristics)

> "Don't make me think." — Steve Krug

## 1. The Interaction Cost

Minimize clicks.
*   **Rule**: 3 Clicks to Value.
*   **Audit**: Count the clicks for the critical path (e.g., Checkout). Can you remove one?

## 2. The Feedback Loop

Every action has a reaction.
*   **Click**: Does the button state change (Active/Loading)?
*   **Error**: Is the error message specific? ("Bad Request" vs "Email is invalid").
*   **Empty State**: When no data exists, do you guide the user?

## 3. Consistency

*   **Buttons**: Do primary buttons always look the same?
*   **Layout**: is the padding consistent?
*   **Language**: Do you mix "Sign In" and "Log In"? (Pick one).

> 🔴 **Rule**: If the user has to guess what an icon means, add a label.
