# The Friction Collider (/friction)

> **Objective**: Crash a specific User Persona into the interface to detect and eliminate resistance.

## 1. Setup: The Particles
**Define the input variables before running the simulation:**
*   **The Interface**: [URL or Content to Audit]
*   **The Goal**: [Single Desired Action, e.g., "Book Demo"]
*   **The Persona**: [Specific Archetype, e.g., "The Skeptical CTO" or "The Stressed Mom"]

## 2. Run The Simulation (The 4 Sweeps)
*Execute the following simulation loop. Do not "review" the copy. BECOME the Persona.*

### Phase 1: Cognitive Force (The Brain)
> *Simulation State: You are tired, you have 15 tabs open, and you are looking for a reason to close this one.*
1.  Scan the headers. Do you understand **exactly** what the offer is in 3 seconds?
2.  Read the first paragraph. Did you have to re-read anything?
3.  Look for "Empty Calories" (words like: solution, seamless, robust, unlock).
4.  **Identify every moment you thought "Wait, what?"**

### Phase 2: Emotional Force (The Heart)
> *Simulation State: You are defensive. You hate being sold to. You smell manipulation.*
1.  Check the "Tone". Does it sound like a human or a marketer?
2.  Check the "Pressure". Is there fake urgency? (Countdowns, "Only 2 left").
3.  Check "Relevance". Does this feel like it was written *for you* or *for everyone*?
4.  **Identify every moment you felt "Ugh" or "Yeah right".**

### Phase 3: Visual Force (The Eyes)
> *Simulation State: You are scrolling fast on a phone. Your thumb is lazy.*
1.  Do the "Squint Test". Is the CTA the most obvious thing on the screen?
2.  Are the paragraphs huge walls of text? (Cognitive wall).
3.  Is the visual hierarchy leading your eye or confusing it?
4.  **Identify every moment your eye stopped flow.**

### Phase 4: Trust Force (The Gut)
> *Simulation State: You have been burned before.*
1.  Look for "Unearned Claims" (Best, #1, World-Class) without proof nearby.
2.  Look for "Generic Vibe" (Stock photos, template look).
3.  Look for "Pricing Games" (Hidden costs, "Contact for quote" on simple tools).
4.  **Identify every moment you thought "Is this real?"**

## 3. The Output: Release The Report
*Present the findings in the [Debris Field] format.*

**The Debris Field**
| Force | The Snag (Specific Text/Element) | The Internal Monologue ("Quote") | The Smooth Slide (The Fix) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cognitive** | [Quote the text] | "I have to read this twice." | [Rewrite it simply] |
| **Trust** | [Describe element] | "This looks fake." | [Specific proof element] |

**Summary**:
*   **Total Snags Detected**: [Number]
*   **Friction Score**: [High/Medium/Low]
*   **Critical Killers**: [The top 3 things that kill the sale immediately]
