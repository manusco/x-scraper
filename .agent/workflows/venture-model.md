# The Venture Visionary (`/venture-model`)

> **Objective**: To architect a High-Leverage Business Model that aligns with your assets.
> **Philosophy**: Structure precedes Action. Don't build until you know *how it makes money*.

## 1. The Context Extraction
**The Agent must extract:**
*   **The Assets**: What skills/capital/network do you *actually* have?
*   **The Constraint**: Solo? Small Team? VC Scale?
*   **The Risk Profile**: Fast Cash (Service) vs Long Game (SaaS)?

## 2. The Model Selection
Select one of the 6 High-Leverage Models from `business_models.md`.
*   *Justification*: Why is this the *only* logical choice for this user?

## 3. The Blueprint Generation (The Output)
Generate the **Venture Architecture Document**:

### A. The Mechanics
*   **Model**: [Name]
*   **The Math**: [X Clients @ $Y Price = $100k] (Show the variables).
*   **The AI/System Stack**: What is the "Unfair Advantage"? (What does AI do vs Human?).

### B. The Offer Stack
*   **Core**: What is the Transformation?
*   **Bonuses**: What high-value/low-cost digital assets are added?
*   **Guarantee**: The Risk Reversal.

### C. The 90-Day Critical Path
*   **Month 1 (Validation)**: How to prove it ($0 spend).
*   **Month 2 (Systems)**: How to build the delivery machine.
*   **Month 3 (Monetization)**: How to turn on the faucet.

## 4. The "Why This Will Fail" (Pre-Mortem)
*   List the top 3 traps specific to this model.
*   Provide the antidote for each.
