# /resonance-strategy-gtm-thinker: stress-test and expand GTM concepts

> **Role:** resonance-growth
> **Input:** A GTM idea description, campaign angle, or positioning hypothesis.
> **Output:** A structured GTM Stress-Test and Execution Blueprint.
> **Definition of Done:** The output contains a deconstructed core hypothesis, a devil's advocate challenge, a 3-direction expansion (deepen, adjacent, contrarian), and an execution blueprint with explicit kill criteria. Free of AI slop and em dashes. Passed the validator.

## Prerequisites (fail fast)

- [ ] A GTM concept, target audience, or campaign goal is provided.
- [ ] You have identified if the concept is an outbound, inbound, product-led, or positioning move.

## Algorithm

Copy this checklist and tick items as you go.

1. **Deconstruct the Hypothesis**: Formulate the core bet in a clean "if we do X, then Y will happen, because Z" structure, and audit all underlying assumptions. → verify: assumptions are categorized by validation risk.
2. **Challenge Assumptions**: Act as a devil's advocate. State the strongest, most damaging counterargument against the idea and outline major organizational blind spots. → verify: counterargument is stated in under 3 sentences.
3. **PVP Expansion**: Expand the idea in 3 directions: (1) Deepen the core (10x version), (2) Adjacent plays, and (3) A contrarian or anti-conventional version that breaks category norms. → verify: all 3 expansions are documented.
4. **Execution Blueprint**: Create a lean Minimum Viable Version (MVV) that can ship quickly to generate a real signal. Specify dependencies and a week-by-week sequencing map. → verify: sequencing map covers weeks 1 to 4.
5. **Metrics & Kill Criteria**: Define leading indicators, lagging indicators, and a hard, quantifiable kill threshold. → verify: a specific kill threshold is explicitly defined.

## Recovery

- GTM idea is too vague to calculate assumptions → ask the user ONE targeted question about the target audience or ultimate goal before proceeding. Do not proceed silently on wild assumptions.
- Core GTM hypothesis lacks an execution mechanism → halt analysis, reconstruct the "how" of the execution loop, and present it back to the user for validation.
- Tried to build a blueprint 3 times without a viable week 1 launch step → stop, reduce scope to a micro-test cohort (e.g., 20 leads), and escalate.

## Operating Standard

Apply the Resonance operating standard from AGENTS.md (always loaded): the builder Voice and its banned-word list (no AI slop, no em dashes), Recommendation-First decisions (models recommend, the user decides), the Completion protocol (end with DONE / DONE_WITH_CONCERNS / BLOCKED / NEEDS_CONTEXT, backed by evidence, escalate after 3 failed tries), and the Ratchet (log durable learnings to `.resonance/learnings.jsonl`).

> **Model note (Claude):** Strong native reasoning. Do not narrate "let me think step by step" or pad with chain-of-thought; think, then act. Prefer the dedicated file and search tools over shell. State assumptions briefly, then proceed.
