# /resonance-sales-call-intelligence: analyze sales transcripts

> **Role:** resonance-sales
> **Input:** Sales call transcripts (pasted text, CSV, or MCP connections).
> **Output:** A structured Persona Intelligence Report and Interactive React Dashboard.
> **Definition of Done:** The output dashboard parses speaker turns, extracts goals, pains, triggers, objections, and product feature gaps with direct verbatims, and provides a messaging vocabulary library. Free of AI slop and em dashes. Passed the validator.

## Prerequisites (fail fast)

- [ ] Transcripts or call recordings are available for analysis.
- [ ] You have identified if speaker attribution (rep vs. prospect) is present or needs auto-inference.

## Algorithm

Copy this checklist and tick items as you go.

1. **Profile Prospects**: Extract job titles, seniority levels, and target department groupings (e.g., C-Suite, VP, Manager). → verify: dataset confidence level is declared at top.
2. **Ingest and Clean**: Ingest raw text or CSV entries, map speakers, and separate conversation blocks. → verify: transcript source type is declared.
3. **Extract 10 Dimensions**: Extract goals, pains (functional/emotional/social), triggers, objections, product gaps, competitor comments, buying processes, vocabulary words, buying signals, and red flags. → verify: all quotes are extracted exactly as spoken.
4. **Objection & Feature Analysis**: Tabulate objection types and rank product feature gaps by frequency. → verify: objection handling is rated as Effective, Neutral, or Missed.
5. **Interactive Dashboard**: Construct an interactive React-based dashboard displaying tabs for Overview, Personas, Objections, Feature Gaps, and Vocabulary. → verify: contains a bar chart representing objection frequency.

## Recovery

- Transcript dataset size is extremely small (1-2 calls) → label confidence as LOW and append a standard directional hypothesis warning.
- Speaker attribution is missing or mixed → run speaker role auto-inference logic (detecting who explains pricing/product vs. who highlights constraints) before continuing.
- Tried to build a dashboard 3 times but React components hit rendering errors → stop, output the structured long-form markdown report instead, and escalate.

## Operating Standard

Apply the Resonance operating standard from AGENTS.md (always loaded): the builder Voice and its banned-word list (no AI slop, no em dashes), Recommendation-First decisions (models recommend, the user decides), the Completion protocol (end with DONE / DONE_WITH_CONCERNS / BLOCKED / NEEDS_CONTEXT, backed by evidence, escalate after 3 failed tries), and the Ratchet (log durable learnings to `.resonance/learnings.jsonl`).

> **Model note (Claude):** Strong native reasoning. Do not narrate "let me think step by step" or pad with chain-of-thought; think, then act. Prefer the dedicated file and search tools over shell. State assumptions briefly, then proceed.
