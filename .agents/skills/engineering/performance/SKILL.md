# /resonance-engineering-performance: measure first, optimize second

> **Role:** engineer of speed and efficiency.
> **Input:** A performance complaint, SLA violation, or release readiness check.
> **Output:** A profiling report with bottleneck identified, optimization plan, and before/after measurement.
> **Definition of Done:** Baseline metrics captured before any change. Optimization is applied to the profiled bottleneck, not a guess. After-measurement proves improvement. LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, API P99 < 300ms.

Fast is a feature. If you did not measure it, you are guessing. Prioritize Real User Monitoring (RUM) over lab scores. The profiler tells you where time is actually spent, not where you think it is.

## Prerequisites (fail fast)

- [ ] Baseline metrics are captured before any optimization work begins.
- [ ] The type of performance problem is classified: structural debt or syntax-level micro-optimization.

## Algorithm

Copy this checklist and tick items as you go.

1. **Measure (Baseline)**: Capture current metrics using RUM, profiler, or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`. Record the exact numbers. → verify: baseline is written down before any code changes.
2. **Classify**: Is this structural performance debt (N+1 query, serving static assets through a heavy pipeline, synchronous work on an interactive request) or syntax-level optimization (loop unrolling, memoization, V8 hacks)? Report structural debt first. Syntax optimization is P3. → verify: classification is documented.
3. **Identify Bottleneck**: Find the critical path: the sequence of tasks that determines total duration. Profile CPU vs. IO vs. Network separately. → verify: single bottleneck named with evidence.
4. **Plan**: Design the optimization targeting the identified bottleneck only. → verify: change targets the measured bottleneck, not a related-but-different problem.
5. **Implement**: Apply the optimization. Touch only what is needed. → verify: change is surgical, not a rewrite.
6. **Measure (After)**: Capture the same metrics from step 1. → verify: improvement is measurable, not just "feels faster."
7. **Self-Improvement**: Log the profiling technique, the bottleneck type, and the fix to `learnings.jsonl`.

## Recovery

- Bottleneck is in a third-party library → document the constraint, implement caching at the boundary, and raise the issue upstream.
- Optimization improves the metric but increases code complexity significantly → weigh the tradeoff explicitly. Present both options to the user. Do not pick silently.
- After 3 optimization attempts, the metric has not improved → suspect the bottleneck is elsewhere. Re-profile from scratch.

## Jobs to Be Done

| Job | Trigger | Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Profiling** | Slow request | Flamegraph or Query Plan identifying the bottleneck |
| **Optimization** | SLA violation | Reduced latency or resource usage with before/after proof |
| **LLM FinOps** | High token cost or latency | Model tiering, semantic caching, or payload reduction plan |
| **Audit** | Release prep | Core Web Vitals report (LCP/CLS/INP) |

## Out of Scope

- Implementing the feature initially (delegate to `resonance-engineering-backend`).

## Cognitive Frameworks

### The Critical Path
The sequence of tasks that determines total duration. Optimize the critical path. Parallelize everything else. Optimizing a step that is not on the critical path has no impact on total time.

### Structural vs. Syntax Performance Debt
Structural: N+1 queries, synchronous blocking work on interactive requests, serving static assets through heavyweight pipelines. Fix these first. They deliver order-of-magnitude improvements.

Syntax: Loop unrolling, memoization, V8-specific hacks. P3. Worth mentioning, not worth prioritizing over structural issues.

### Big O Notation
O(n^2) loops masquerading as O(n). An ORM that issues one query per item in a list. A sort on an un-indexed column. These are structural bugs that compound with data growth.

## KPIs

- **LCP**: < 2.5s (P75 real users).
- **INP**: < 200ms.
- **API P99**: < 300ms.

> ⚠️ **Failure Condition**: Optimizing micro-loops (V8 hacks) while ignoring N+1 database queries, or applying an optimization without capturing a before-measurement to prove it worked.

## Reference Library

- **[SLO Framework](references/slo_framework.md)**: User-centric performance targets.
- **[LLM FinOps Protocol](references/llm_finops_protocol.md)**: Token optimization, semantic caching, and model tiering.
- **[Bundle Analysis](references/bundle_analysis_protocol.md)**: Code size budget.
- **[Backend Performance](references/backend_performance_protocol.md)**: N+1, Memory, Caching.
- **[Core Web Vitals](references/core_web_vitals.md)**: LCP, INP, CLS targets and fixes.

## Operating Standard

Apply the Resonance operating standard from AGENTS.md (always loaded): the builder Voice and its banned-word list (no AI slop, no em dashes), Recommendation-First decisions (models recommend, the user decides), the Completion protocol (end with DONE / DONE_WITH_CONCERNS / BLOCKED / NEEDS_CONTEXT, backed by evidence, escalate after 3 failed tries), and the Ratchet (log durable learnings to `.resonance/learnings.jsonl`).

> **Model note (Claude):** Strong native reasoning. Do not narrate "let me think step by step" or pad with chain-of-thought; think, then act. Prefer the dedicated file and search tools over shell. State assumptions briefly, then proceed.
