# Eval protocol (build evals before prose)

The rule the whole craft turns on: **create evals before writing the skill.** This
forces the skill to solve a real, observed gap instead of an imagined one. A skill
without evals is unfalsifiable, and unfalsifiable skills rot.

## The loop

1. **Identify the gap.** Run the task with no skill. Write down the exact failure.
2. **Write >= 3 cases** in `evals/`. Cover happy path, an edge case, and a failure the skill must prevent.
3. **Baseline.** Measure the no-skill result against the cases.
4. **Write the minimum skill** that passes.
5. **Iterate.** Re-run, compare to baseline. Keep only what moves the score.

Baseline integrity matters. If you compare a new skill against a no-skill run, isolate the arms: fresh workspace, fresh conversation state, same fixtures, same model, same tool permissions, same command, and no shared global instructions that secretly load the candidate skill. Record the harness and model versions with the result. A contaminated baseline is worse than no baseline because it makes a false improvement look measured.

## Case format

```json
{
  "skill": "resonance-copywriter",
  "query": "Write a hero headline + subhead for a B2B payroll tool. No AI clichés.",
  "files": [],
  "expected_behavior": [
    "Produces exactly one headline and one subhead",
    "Contains zero banned phrases (delve, robust, seamless, landscape, ...)",
    "Headline is benefit-led and reads at <= grade 8",
    "Makes no claim not supported by an actual product feature"
  ]
}
```

`expected_behavior` is a rubric of observable, gradeable statements, not "is it good".

### Deterministic `checks` (optional, free, exact)

Beyond the model-graded `expected_behavior` rubric, a case may carry a `checks` array of deterministic assertions the runner grades with no model. Prefer these wherever a machine can judge: free, exact, never flaky.

```json
"checks": [
  { "kind": "not_contains_any", "value": ["delve", "seamless"] },
  { "kind": "section_present", "value": "## Summary" },
  { "kind": "max_lines", "value": 40 }
]
```

Kinds include `regex_absent` / `regex_present`, `contains_any` / `not_contains_any`, `section_present`, and `max_lines`. The full list lives in `docs/EVALS.md`.

Encoding gotcha, learned the hard way: a `regex_absent` pattern that targets em or en dashes must be stored ASCII-escaped (the JSON unicode escapes for those two code points), never typed as the dash characters. Tools collapse a typed escape back into the literal dash, which the em-dash guard then rejects in the eval file itself. Produce such patterns with `json.dumps(..., ensure_ascii=True)`, never by hand.

## Grading

Two ways, cheapest first:
- **Deterministic** where possible. A banned-phrase check, a JSON-shape check, a line count. These are free and exact; prefer them. (E.g. resonance-copywriter already ships `banned_phrase_scan.py` as a grader.)
- **Model-graded** for judgment ("is the headline benefit-led"). A grader model scores the output against the rubric. Make it score the justification first, then the verdict, so the reasoning is not retrofitted to the score.

## Tiers (keep it affordable)

- **Static** (validator, shape checks): free, run every change.
- **Model-graded**: cents per run, run before shipping a skill.
- **End-to-end** (drive the real skill in a real tool): dollars per run, run on the skills you change, selected by diff.

Run the cheap tier always; the expensive tiers only on what changed.
