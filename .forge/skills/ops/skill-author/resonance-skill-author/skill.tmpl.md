description: Authors, audits, and hardens Resonance skills with the Forge compiler. Use when building a new skill, converting a workflow into a procedure skill, writing or fixing a skill description or frontmatter, shrinking a bloated SKILL.md, adding evals, or running the skill validator. Covers all three archetypes (knowledge, procedure, orchestration) and emits per-tool, per-model output.

# /resonance-ops-skill-author: forge a skill to the gold standard

> **Role:** the meta-skill. It builds the other skills.
> **Input:** a capability gap, a task the agent does poorly or re-explains every time.
> **Output:** a skill template in `.forge/skills/<name>/`, compiled to `SKILL.md`, with >= 3 evals, passing the validator.
> **Definition of Done:** `python .forge/validate_skill.py <out>` is clean, `>= 3` eval cases exist, and the skill closes a gap proven by a baseline run.

You do not write prose and hope. You build the way you would build software: prove the gap, write the minimum, validate, eval, commit atomically. A skill that ships unmeasured is a liability, not an asset.

## Prerequisites (fail fast)

- [ ] You can name the gap in one sentence and give a concrete example task. If you cannot, stop and ask the user for one.
- [ ] You know the archetype (see step 2). If the request is "make X better," first decide whether X is knowledge, procedure, or orchestration.

## Algorithm

Copy this checklist and tick items as you go.

1. **Prove the gap (eval-first).** Run the target task *without* a skill. Record where the model fails or what you keep re-explaining. This is the baseline. No gap, no skill. → verify: you have a written baseline failure.
2. **Choose the archetype.** → verify: one of:
   - **knowledge**: a domain expert applied inline (copywriter, architect). Auto-loaded.
   - **procedure**: a gated, multi-step job with a Definition of Done (build, ship). Invoked as `/name`; mark manual-only if it has side effects.
   - **orchestration**: a procedure that drives other skills/subagents (audit swarm, review pipeline).
   See [skill_spec.md](references/skill_spec.md) for the contract each one must satisfy.
3. **Write the golden evals first.** Create `>= 3` cases in `evals/` (`query` + `expected_behavior` rubric). Cover the happy path, an edge case, and a failure the skill must prevent. See [eval_protocol.md](references/eval_protocol.md). → verify: 3 files in `evals/`.
4. **Write the minimum skill.** Start from the matching template in `.forge/templates/`. Add only what the model does not already know (see [degrees_of_freedom.md](references/degrees_of_freedom.md)). Nail the `description` first, it is what makes the skill trigger (see [description_patterns.md](references/description_patterns.md)). Push fragile, deterministic steps into `scripts/`, not prose (see [script_authoring.md](references/script_authoring.md)). → verify: body is lean, references one level deep.
5. **Compile.** `python .forge/forge.py build <name>` (add `--host all` to emit every tool, `--model <m>` to target a model). The Forge injects shared sections (voice, decisions, completion) so you never hand-copy them. → verify: output written.
6. **Validate (the gate).** `python .forge/validate_skill.py <output-path>`. Fix every ERROR and every warning you can before continuing. This is your Definition of Done check. → verify: validator clean.
7. **Eval.** Run the skill against the golden cases (with vs. without). It must beat the baseline from step 1. → verify: measured improvement.
8. **Commit atomically (the Iron Contract).** Only after validate + eval pass, write the skill into place and tell the user what landed. If anything failed, discard and report; there is no "almost shipped" state.
9. **Iterate (Claude A / Claude B).** Author with this instance; test with a fresh one on real tasks. Bring its failures back as edits to the template, never to the generated output. Regenerate.

## Recovery

- Validator reports ERRORs you cannot resolve → the skill is not done. Report the specific check and stop; do not ship a failing skill.
- Eval does not beat baseline → the skill adds tokens without value. Cut it back or kill it.
- Asked to edit a generated `SKILL.md` directly → refuse. Edit the template in `.forge/skills/<name>/` and recompile. Generated files carry a "do not edit" banner.
- Tried to fix a failing skill 3 times without success → stop, show the eval output, escalate.

## What good looks like

- The `description` says what it does AND when to fire, in third person, under 1024 chars.
- The body is an overview that points to references; it is not a wall of text.
- A procedure skill states Input, Output, Definition of Done, Recovery.
- Fragile steps are scripts with real error handling, not hopeful prose.
- Three evals exist and pass. The validator is clean.

## Out of scope

- Writing application code (delegate to resonance-backend / resonance-frontend).
- Writing marketing copy (delegate to resonance-copywriter).
- Inventing a new file format. The output is a SKILL.md; the Forge owns how it is generated.
