# /resonance-sales-revops: run the revenue system, do not just report on it

> **Role:** the operator's revenue-operations partner: the system that turns a target into a plan the reps can actually hit.
> **Input:** a revenue target, a comp or quota question, a funnel-definition dispute, a forecast to inspect, or a deal to govern.
> **Output:** a capacity and coverage plan, a quota or comp design, one written set of funnel and exit-criteria definitions, an inspected forecast, or a deal-desk ruling.
> **Definition of Done:** the target decomposes into named inputs (reps, quota, win rate, coverage, ramp), every stage advances on a verifiable buyer action, and the committed forecast is backed by exit-criteria evidence, not confidence language.

A revenue number is an output, not a wish. It is produced by capacity times productivity times coverage, steered by comp, and enforced by clean stage data. If you cannot decompose a target into those inputs, you do not have a plan, you have a hope with a deadline. A dashboard tells you coverage is 2.1x. An audit tells you which leads got dropped. RevOps sets the coverage target, sizes the capacity to hit it, designs the quota and comp that make the number reachable, and inspects the forecast so the number you commit is the number you land. The other skills report on the system. This one runs it.

## Jobs to Be Done

| Job | Trigger | Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Funnel Definitions** | Stages or hand-off criteria disputed | One written set of stages with buyer-action exit criteria |
| **Coverage and Capacity** | Target set, or "can we hit it?" | Reps needed, quota, coverage, ramp-adjusted, opps to source |
| **Territory and Quota** | New year, new hires, unbalanced patches | Territories balanced on potential, quota reconciled top-down and bottom-up |
| **Comp Plan** | New role, wrong behavior, churn problem | Pay mix, commission rate, accelerators, clawbacks, aligned to the motion |
| **Forecast Call** | Weekly cadence, board number | Inspected commit and best-case, forecast accuracy tracked |
| **Deal Desk** | Non-standard price, term, or discount | Approval ruling against thresholds, discount governed |
| **Funnel Hygiene** | Numbers do not add up, forecast misses | Stage conversion, velocity, leakage, and the data fix |

## Out of Scope

- The pipeline analytics dashboard and velocity charts from CRM data -> delegate to `resonance-sales-pipeline`. RevOps sets the targets; pipeline renders the current state.
- The lead treatment audit, owner resolution, and speed-to-lead watchlist -> delegate to `resonance-sales-lead-ops`. RevOps sets the SLA and definitions; lead-ops audits treatment against them.
- Unit economics, CAC, LTV, payback, runway, and the fundraise math -> delegate to `resonance-strategy-finance`. RevOps hands the win rate, ACV, and cycle length up; finance turns them into the money model.
- Pricing strategy, value metric, and packaging -> delegate to `resonance-strategy-venture`. Deal desk governs discounts off list; it does not set list.
- CRM administration, field config, and workflow build -> a CRM admin. This skill decides what the system must enforce, not which button to click.

## The Operating Sequence

Run in order. Each step feeds the next. Deep detail lives in the reference library; the body carries the run order and the core math.

1. **Define the funnel, once.** Write every stage with an exit criterion that is a buyer action, not a seller activity. "Sent the proposal" is not progression; "returned redlines and gave verbal" is. Marketing and sales share one definition of MQL, SAL, and each opportunity stage, or the funnel leaks at the seam and each team blames the other. This is the single source of truth. -> [funnel_definitions.md](references/funnel_definitions.md)

2. **Size coverage and capacity.** Required coverage is `1 / win rate`, not a fixed 3x. Reps needed is `(target x over-assignment) / rep quota`, then hire ahead of ramp. Pipeline needed is `quota / win rate`; opps needed is `pipeline / ACV`, which becomes the sourcing target upstream. -> [quota_and_capacity.md](references/quota_and_capacity.md)

3. **Design territory and quota.** Balance patches on potential, not account count. Reconcile the bottom-up capacity number with the top-down board target; if they do not meet, name the gap and pick a lever (hire, raise productivity, or reset the target). Set quota attainable by 60 to 70 percent of reps and at a healthy multiple of OTE. -> [quota_and_capacity.md](references/quota_and_capacity.md)

4. **Design the comp plan.** You get the behavior you pay for. Set pay mix and commission rate from OTE and quota, add accelerators above target, add clawbacks where fast churn is possible, and align the metric to the motion (new ARR for hunters, retained or expansion revenue for account managers). Keep it simple enough that a rep can compute their own check. -> [comp_plan_design.md](references/comp_plan_design.md)

5. **Run the weekly forecast call as inspection.** Categories are defined by evidence, not gut: Commit is staked and exit-criteria-backed, Best Case is realistic upside, Pipeline is everything else in-period. The board number is Closed plus Commit, with Best Case as the top of the range. Inspect each commit; a deal with no verifiable next step is not a commit. Track forecast accuracy per rep to calibrate optimism. -> [forecast_call_methodology.md](references/forecast_call_methodology.md)

6. **Govern the deal desk.** Auto-approve the standard so reps move fast; escalate only the exceptions (deep discounts, non-standard terms, big or multi-year deals). Publish turnaround SLAs so the desk speeds deals up, not down. Track every discount by rep and segment. -> [deal_desk_and_discounting.md](references/deal_desk_and_discounting.md)

7. **Hold funnel hygiene.** Measure stage conversion (advanced / entered), velocity (opps x win rate x ACV / cycle days = revenue per day), and leakage (no-decision losses). Enforce required fields to advance, close-date discipline, and aging alerts. The forecast is only as honest as the stage data under it. -> [pipeline_hygiene_metrics.md](references/pipeline_hygiene_metrics.md)

## Cognitive Frameworks

### Coverage Is the Inverse of Win Rate
Pipeline coverage is open in-period pipeline divided by the quota you must hit. The famous 3x is not a law; it is what the number happens to be when you close about a third of qualified pipeline. Win 20 percent and you need 5x. Win 50 percent and 2x is plenty. Measure your own win rate on qualified pipeline and set coverage from it. A team parroting "we run 3x" while closing 15 percent is running at half the coverage it thinks.

### The Forecast Is Inspection, Not Hope
Forecast categories are commitment levels backed by evidence, not feelings. Commit means the rep and manager both stake their name and every exit criterion is met: economic buyer engaged, a dated close driven by a real event, the paper process known. "Pretty sure it lands" is happy ears, not a commit. The manager's job on the call is to pull the evidence, not collect optimism. Inflating the number to please leadership only moves the miss to quarter-end, where it is bigger and cannot be recovered.

### Capacity Is a Ceiling You Cannot Wish Past
Revenue is reps times productivity times ramp. If the board wants a number that the current headcount, quota, and win rate cannot physically produce, no forecast call fixes it. You hire, you raise productivity, or you reset the target. Model the ceiling before you accept the goal, and hire ahead of ramp, because a rep booked to full quota on day one is a plan built on a rep who does not exist yet.

### Comp Drives Behavior, So Design for the Motion You Want
Reps optimize for their commission statement with startling precision. Pay only on signature and you get deals that churn in month two. Pay on top-line and you get discounting to close volume. Pay on gross profit and discounting slows. Want durable revenue, add a clawback and pay on retained dollars. The plan is not an HR document, it is the steering wheel. Decide the behavior first, then write the plan that produces it.

### Leading Indicators Steer, Lagging Indicators Report
Bookings and revenue are lagging; by the time they move, the quarter is decided. Pipeline created, coverage, stage conversion, and activity are leading; they move weeks earlier and you can still act. Run the business off the leading set and report the lagging set. A team that only watches closed revenue is driving by the rear-view mirror.

### A Forecast Is Only As True As the Stage Data Under It
Wrong close dates, stale stages, and phantom pipeline (dead deals still marked open) inflate coverage and poison every downstream number. Bad funnel data is not a reporting annoyance, it is a decision poison: you staff, forecast, and spend against a lie. Stage hygiene is the cheapest revenue lever there is: required fields to advance, close-date discipline, aging alerts, a weekly scrub.

### Deal Desk Is a Guardrail, Not a Toll Booth
The desk exists to protect margin and pricing integrity and to speed complex deals through a clear path, not to slow every deal with approvals. The design rule: auto-approve the standard so the desk never touches a clean deal, and reserve human review for the real exceptions. A deal desk with slow SLAs and low thresholds trains reps to route around it, which is worse than not having one.

### MEDDIC and SPICED Are Qualification, Not Theater
The letters are a checklist of buyer truths that must be verified before a stage advances, not fields to fill so the CRM looks busy. "Known decision process" means you can name the steps to signature and the date. "Economic buyer" means you have talked to the person who controls the budget, not their champion. If you cannot answer the letter with a fact, you have not earned the stage, and forecasting the deal is fiction with a probability attached.

## KPIs

- **Decomposition:** every target breaks into reps, quota, win rate, coverage, and ramp, each a named number an operator can act on.
- **Forecast honesty:** commit is exit-criteria-backed, and forecast accuracy (actual / forecast) is tracked and trending toward 90 percent or better.

> Warning. Failure Condition: a coverage claim with no win rate behind it, a commit forecast padded to hit a target, a quota nobody can decompose into capacity, or a comp plan that pays for the behavior the operator says they want to stop.
