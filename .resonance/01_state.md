# Current State

## Phase
System Upgraded & Refactored

## Goal
Resonance v2.0 Deployment & Code Elegance Achieved

## Context
- **Framework Version: 2.0 (The Vibe Operating System)**
- **Code Version: 0.1.7**
- **QA Audit**: 47 automated tests passing (100% success rate).
- **Refactor**: `/refactor` protocol executed on `shared/scraper.js`. Duplication resolved, logic simplified.

### Achievements:
1. ✅ **Framework Migration**: Moved to the new `.agent/` and `.resonance/` v2.0 structure.
2. ✅ **Skill & Workflow Deployment**: Initialized 233+ skills and 17 updated workflows.
3. ✅ **Cleaner Logic**: Refactored core scraper into modular helpers with flattened logic.
4. ✅ **Safe Upgrade**: All legacy memory and state preserved during the migration.

## Next Session
- Smoke test v2.0 workflows (e.g., `/debug` or `/plan`).
- Finalize production manifest optimization.
