# Project Soul

## Vision
The definitive, minimalist tool for researchers and content creators to bridge the gap between social threads and permanent memory.

## Principles
1. **Privacy First**: No servers, no tracking. All scraping happens in the local browser context.
2. **Minimalism**: Focus on one job—getting high-quality thread text to the clipboard—and do it perfectly.
3. **Robustness**: Maintain resilience against structural changes in X's front-end using semantic test IDs and flexible filtering.
4. **Clean Code**: Zero duplication, shared logic, and rigorous automated testing.

## Current Focus
Resonance v2.0 structural migration complete. Focus on cross-browser stability and production-ready packaging for Chrome and Firefox.
