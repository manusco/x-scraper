# QA Report: X-Scraper v0.1.7
**Date**: 2026-01-09
**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PRODUCTION

## 1. Destructive Testing (Passed: 47/47)
Successfully implemented and executed a comprehensive test suite using Jest and jsdom.

### Key Test Categories:
- **Edge Cases**: Handled null/undefined inputs and missing DOM elements gracefully.
- **URL Handling**: Verified robust parsing of X/Twitter status URLs.
- **XSS & Injection**: Confirmed that HTML tags and SQL injection patterns are treated as plain text and not executed.
- **Race Conditions**: Verified that rapid UI interactions (multiple clicks) do not crash the extension.
- **Clipboard Integration**: Mocked and verified successful data transfer to system clipboard.

## 2. Security Audit
Performed a thorough STRIDE-based security audit of the extension.

- **Secrets**: 0 secrets/API keys found in codebase (grep scan).
- **Permissions**: Manifest permissions are minimal and scoped correctly (`activeTab`, `clipboardWrite`, `scripting`).
- **Data Leakage**: Verified that no sensitive user data is logged or transmitted to external servers.
- **Input Sanitization**: Scraper logic uses `.innerText` (DOM-native) for extraction, providing inherent protection against XSS.

## 3. Performance Review
- **DOM Efficiency**: Optimized selector usage (`data-testid`) ensures fast lookups even in large threads.
- **Memory Management**: Uses `Map` for deduplication, keeping memory footprint low during long scrapes.
- **Concurrency**: State-controlled loop prevents multiple simultaneous scrapes from conflicting.
- **Latency**: No unnecessary network calls; all operations are local to the browser tab.

## 4. Verdict
The system has been thoroughly attacked and has proven its resilience. 
**No critical or major bugs found.**

> [!TIP]
> **Future Recommendation**
> While the current selector-based scraping is robust, adding a monitoring check for X's DOM changes would increase long-term reliability.
